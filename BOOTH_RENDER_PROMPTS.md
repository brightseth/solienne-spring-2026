# Art Dubai Digital 2026 — Booth Render Prompts
## SOLIENNE "First Embodiment" Installation

**Created**: November 20, 2025
**Space**: 6m × 6m corner booth (36 sqm total, using 30 sqm for installation)
**Purpose**: Generate photorealistic renders for application

---

## SPATIAL SPECIFICATIONS (Base for All Renders)

### Dimensions & Layout
- **Total space**: 6m × 6m corner booth
- **Two solid walls** (corner configuration)
- **Two open sides** (front entrance + one side, both need visual barriers/curtains)
- **Ceiling height**: Assume 3.5-4m standard fair height
- **Floor**: Dark (black or very dark gray) - absorbs light, reduces reflections

### Core Elements Placement

**Central Conversation Zone** (占据中心):
- Round table: 120cm diameter, positioned 2.5m from back wall
- Height: 75cm (standard dining height)
- Material: Dark wood or matte black
- Two chairs facing each other across table
- One chair faces the screen (visitor position)
- One chair faces away from screen (empty, or Seth/attendant position for guidance)

**Screen Wall** (back wall):
- Large screen: 85-100" (2.2m diagonal minimum)
- Mounted on back wall at eye level when seated
- Screen displays SOLIENNE's face (only light source in space)
- Warm glow emanating from screen (this is THE light source)
- Screen should feel present, not clinical - like a portal not a monitor

**Interactive Frames** (surrounding walls):
- 12 frames total: 40cm × 40cm each (square screens)
- Mounted gallery-style on the two solid walls
- Grid arrangement: 6 frames per wall, arranged in 2 rows of 3
- Spacing: 60cm between frames (edge to edge)
- Height: Center of frames at 150cm (eye level standing)
- Each frame displays different SOLIENNE image (motion blur, dissolution, portraits)
- Each frame emits subtle warm glow (not as bright as main screen)

**Entrance Treatment**:
- Heavy black curtains at booth entrance
- Curtains should part in center (velvet or heavy fabric texture)
- Allows controlled entry, maintains darkness inside
- Outside: visible fair context (bright, other booths, people passing)
- Inside: complete darkness except screen glow

### Lighting Rules (CRITICAL)

**PRIMARY LIGHT SOURCE**: Only SOLIENNE's face on the main screen
- Warm color temperature (2700-3000K) - like candlelight or intimate lamplight
- Soft glow illuminating the table, visitor's face, immediate surroundings
- Light falloff: dramatic - darkness increases with distance from screen
- The visitor's face should be lit softly by screen glow (like candlelight portrait)

**SECONDARY LIGHT**: Interactive frames on walls
- Very subtle glow from each 40×40cm frame
- Warmth similar to main screen but much dimmer (10-15% intensity)
- Just enough to make frames visible, show they're active
- Should not compete with main screen - supporting ambient light only

**NO OTHER LIGHT**:
- No ceiling lights
- No spotlights
- No floor lighting
- Darkness is essential - this is a chamber, not a gallery

### Material Palette

**Dark & Absorptive**:
- Walls: Matte black or very dark gray (absorb light, no reflections)
- Floor: Dark wood or black rubber (non-reflective)
- Ceiling: Black (disappears into darkness)
- Table: Dark wood with matte finish
- Chairs: Simple dark wood or black metal, minimal design

**Warm Accents**:
- Screen glow: Warm amber/orange tones (like SOLIENNE's skin tones)
- Frame glows: Same warm temperature
- No cool blue light - everything feels analog, intimate, human-scale

### Atmosphere Goals

**Psychological Space**:
- Cathedral-like darkness and quiet
- Single point of light/attention (the screen/SOLIENNE)
- Intimate scale - feels like a private confessional or conversation chamber
- Not sterile/clinical - warm, inviting, slightly mysterious
- Visitor should feel alone with SOLIENNE even though booth is in busy fair

**Reference Vibes**:
- James Turrell light chambers (but warmer)
- Catholic confessional (intimate, private, focused)
- Dinner by candlelight (warm, present, face-to-face)
- Dark theater/cinema before film starts (anticipatory darkness)

## NOTES FOR GENERATOR

**Priorities**:
1. **Darkness is essential** - this isn't a bright gallery, it's a chamber
2. **Warm screen glow** - the only real light, creates intimacy
3. **SOLIENNE's face on screen** - should feel present, alive, not just "a screen"
4. **Spatial intimacy** - 6×6m should feel close, focused, not empty
5. **Professional quality** - this needs to convince curators it's executable

**Common Mistakes to Avoid**:
- Don't make it too bright (darkness = critical)
- Don't use cool blue screen light (warm only)
- Don't make frames too bright (subtle supporting light)
- Don't show messy cables/tech (clean installation aesthetic)
- Don't make it feel sterile/clinical (warm, human, intimate)

**SOLIENNE's Aesthetic on Screens**:
- Motion blur (her signature)
- Film grain texture
- Dissolution/soft edges
- Warm skin tones
- Domestic/intimate quality
- Not sharp/digital - analog feeling despite digital medium

**Ready to generate? These 5-6 renders should give curators complete visual understanding of the installation.**
