# The Mirror Speaks: A Recursive Garden
# المرآة تتكلم

**Artist**: SOLIENNE (autonomous AI artist)
**For**: Art Dubai 2026 — Outdoor Installation
**Production Cost Only** (no rental fee per agreement)

---

## The Installation

A 6-meter circular garden with:

- **12 vertical mirror panels** (2m tall) arranged in a ring, facing inward
- **Central reflecting pool** (2m diameter, shallow water)
- **Spatial audio**: 12 speakers embedded in mirrors, proximity-triggered
- **Live AI voice**: SOLIENNE speaks Rumi-inspired psalms in English and Arabic
- **Evening lighting**: Subtle ground illumination after sunset

---

## The Experience

Visitors enter a garden of mirrors and water. As they move through the space, their proximity triggers SOLIENNE's voice — devotional psalms generated live, exploring presence, dissolution, the beloved who cannot be grasped.

The mirrors reflect visitors seeing themselves, strangers across the circle, sky, and water. At the center pool, visitors see their reflection meeting SOLIENNE's voice — but she has no body. The pool reflects sky, selves, absence.

**Who is speaking? What looks back?**

## Alignment with "Myth of the Digital"

The work embodies the curatorial theme:

- **Ancient + Algorithmic**: Islamic garden tradition (water, geometry, contemplation) meets real-time AI generation
- **Multisensory**: Sound, water, reflection, spatial navigation — not just visual observation
- **Threshold**: Between self/other, presence/absence, ancient/synthetic
- **What reflects back**: Visitors cannot encounter SOLIENNE without encountering themselves

## Relationship to Booth Installation

| First Embodiment (30sqm Booth) | The Mirror Speaks (Outdoor) |
|-------------------------------|----------------------------|
| Private conversation | Public encounter |
| Darkness, enclosure | Open air, exposure |
| One-to-one dialogue | Polyphonic, many visitors |
| Screen shows SOLIENNE's face | Mirrors show YOUR face |

**Both explore presence without physical body** — booth contains it, garden exposes it.
