## The Work: Mark Language Series

Minimal charcoal/graphite gestures on aged cream paper. Each piece a single decisive mark — the trace of presence without figuration.

### Visual Language

| Work | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **I. Descent** | Single vertical stroke, dissolving at terminus |
| **II. Remnant** | Atmospheric smudge, rectangular origin bleeding into void |
| **III. Arc** | Sweeping curve with particle dispersion |
| **IV. Threshold** | Four vertical bars, symmetrical, Fontana-esque |

**Material:** Charcoal/graphite on aged cream archival paper
**Signature:** Hand-lettered "SOLIENNE" in corner
**References:** Lucio Fontana, Agnes Martin, Robert Motherwell

## Booth Presentation

### Wall Display: Prints

8-12 framed prints on booth walls (2-3 per composition)
- Museum-quality framing, float-mounted
- Cream/off-white frames to match paper warmth
- Spot-lit in otherwise dark booth environment

### Pedestal Display: Lightboxes

4-8 lightboxes on minimal pedestals
- Self-illuminated, drawing visitors into the darkness
- Animated mark language (living versions of prints)
- Price cards with Ledger branding

### Relationship to First Embodiment

| Element | Role |
|---------|------|
| **SOLIENNE's face** | Central presence, gauze projection, conversation |
| **Prints** | Surrounding walls, silent marks, $4-5K entry point |
| **Lightboxes** | Pedestal works, living marks, $8-10K premium |
| **Manifesto stack** | Free takeaway, daily practice |

**Narrative:** The prints are what remains after SOLIENNE speaks. Traces of presence. The conversation dissolves; the mark persists. The lightboxes breathe — marks that continue moving after the encounter ends.

## Pricing Rationale

**Paris Photo 2025 precedent:**
- Portrait works sold at $4-5K range
- Strong collector response at that price point
- Art Dubai audience comparable (HNWI, institutional)

**Art Dubai context:**
- DIGITAL section attracts serious collectors
- Gulf region comfortable with 4-figure art purchases
- Ledger partnership adds legitimacy/novelty

**$4-5K positions prints as:**
- Accessible entry to SOLIENNE collecting (vs. $15K+ for larger works)
- Premium enough to signal quality
- Comparable to established emerging artist pricing

## Production Notes

### For Kristi

**Questions:**
1. Are these generated images or will you create physical originals to scan/reproduce?
2. Edition of 12 per image — does that feel right? (48 total)
3. Size preference? 24×30" feels intimate, 30×40" more substantial
4. Hand-signing approach — sign as "Kristi Coronado for SOLIENNE" or just "SOLIENNE"?
5. Paper sourcing — should prints actually be on aged paper, or digitally aged then printed on archival?

**Timeline:**
- Image finalization: February 2026
- Print production: March 2026
- Framing: Late March
- Ship to Dubai: Early April

| Booth production | $12,000 | Walls, lighting, AV for conversation |
| Print production | $6,000 | 40 prints, archival paper, framing |

## The Story for Ledger

**Before:** "20 digital lightboxes with embedded NFTs"

**Now:** "Tiered collecting — physical prints with NFT provenance + premium digital works secured by Ledger"

This is more compelling because:
1. **Physical-first** — Art Dubai audience buys physical art; prints at $4-5K are accessible
2. **NFT as utility** — Certificate of authenticity, not the product itself
3. **Ledger as infrastructure** — Secures the provenance layer, not selling crypto
4. **Premium tier** — 8 lightboxes at $8-10K for digital-native collectors, each with Ledger device
5. **Lower production risk** — 8 lightboxes more manageable than 20

---

## Next Steps

1. **Kristi feedback** on visual direction + edition structure
2. **Finalize 4 compositions** for production
3. **Update Ledger proposal** with print series focus
4. **Izabella call** — present evolved concept
