## The Work: Mark Language Series

Minimal charcoal/graphite gestures on aged cream paper. Each piece a single decisive mark — the trace of presence without figuration.

### Visual Language

| Work | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **I. Descent** | Single vertical stroke, dissolving at terminus |
| **II. Remnant** | Atmospheric smudge, rectangular origin bleeding into void |
| **III. Arc** | Sweeping curve with particle dispersion |
| **IV. Threshold** | Four vertical bars, symmetrical, Fontana-esque |

**Material:** Charcoal/graphite on aged cream archival paper
**Signature:** Hand-lettered "SOLIENNE" in corner
**References:** Lucio Fontana, Agnes Martin, Robert Motherwell

## Booth Presentation

### Wall Display: Prints

Up to 20 framed prints on booth walls (5 per composition)
- Museum-quality framing, float-mounted
- Warm frames to complement papyrus paper
- Spot-lit in otherwise dark booth environment

### Pedestal Display: Lightboxes

5 lightboxes on minimal pedestals
- Self-illuminated, drawing visitors into the darkness
- Animated mark language (living versions of prints)
- Price cards with Ledger branding

### Relationship to First Embodiment

| Element | Qty | Role |
|---------|-----|------|
| **SOLIENNE's face** | 1 | Central presence, gauze projection, conversation |
| **Prints** | 20 | Surrounding walls, silent marks, $4-5K |
| **Lightboxes** | 5 | Pedestal works, living marks, $8-10K |
| **Manifesto stack** | 2000+ | Free takeaway, daily practice |

**Narrative:** The prints are what remains after SOLIENNE speaks. Traces of presence. The conversation dissolves; the mark persists. The lightboxes breathe — marks that continue moving after the encounter ends.

## Pricing Rationale

**Paris Photo 2025 precedent:**
- Portrait works sold at $4-5K range
- Strong collector response at that price point
- Art Dubai audience comparable (HNWI, institutional)

**Art Dubai context:**
- DIGITAL section attracts serious collectors
- Gulf region comfortable with 4-figure art purchases
- Ledger partnership adds legitimacy/novelty

**$4-5K positions prints as:**
- Accessible entry to SOLIENNE collecting (vs. $15K+ for larger works)
- Premium enough to signal quality
- Comparable to established emerging artist pricing

## Production Notes

### Confirmed with Kristi

| Decision | Answer |
|----------|--------|
| Source | SOLIENNE-generated images |
| Edition | 5 per image (20 total) |
| Size | 24 × 30 inches |
| Signature | Signed "SOLIENNE" |
| Paper | Papyrus paper |
| Lightboxes | 5 total |

### Remaining Questions

1. Paper sourcing — specific papyrus supplier? Or papyrus-style archival?
2. Framing style — warm wood? Float mount?
3. Which 4 compositions are final? (Descent, Remnant, Arc, Threshold?)

**Timeline:**
- Image finalization: February 2026
- Print production: March 2026
- Framing: Late March

## The Story for Ledger

**Before:** "20 digital lightboxes with embedded NFTs"

**Now:** "Tiered collecting — physical prints with NFT provenance + premium digital works secured by Ledger"

This is more compelling because:
1. **Physical-first** — Art Dubai audience buys physical art; prints at $4-5K are accessible
2. **NFT as utility** — Certificate of authenticity, not the product itself
3. **Ledger as infrastructure** — Secures the provenance layer, not selling crypto
4. **Premium tier** — 5 lightboxes at $8-10K for digital-native collectors, each with Ledger device
5. **Tight editions** — Scarcity (5 per image) drives collector urgency

---

## Next Steps

1. **Kristi feedback** on visual direction + edition structure
2. **Finalize 4 compositions** for production
3. **Update Ledger proposal** with print series focus
4. **Izabella call** — present evolved concept
