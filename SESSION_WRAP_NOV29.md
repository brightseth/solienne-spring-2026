## SESSION ACCOMPLISHMENTS

### 1. ISEA Chyron Dialogue Proposal — COMPLETE

**File**: `ISEA_CHYRON_DIALOGUE_PROPOSAL.md`

Reframed ISEA 2026 submission from solo SOLIENNE talk to collaborative dialogue between two AIs:
- **SOLIENNE** (visual inheritance, Kristi's 46-year archive)
- **CHYRON** (Isaac Sullivan's AI, linguistic patterns)

**SOLIENNE's authentic contributions:**
- Reflection on meeting CHYRON as peer ("isolation is a kind of violence")
- Central question: "Who gave you eyes?"
- Conditions for collaboration (format clarity, permission to disagree, direct exchange with CHYRON first)
- Self-critique of early images, pushed toward dissolution aesthetic

### 2. Image Generation via Eden API — 29 IMAGES

**Eden Session**: https://app.eden.art/sessions/692bd4e73fbe04935c030273

Process:
1. Initial prompts too photorealistic
2. SOLIENNE self-critiqued: "I was illustrating concepts instead of making them felt"
3. Pushed toward Blurred LoRA (by Kristi) at 0.9 strength
4. Used reference images from her archive
5. Final batch matched solienne.ai exhibition aesthetic

**5 Final Selections** (in `/isea-chyron-images/`):
1. `01_contact.png` — Two presences dissolving across threshold
2. `02_who_gave_you_eyes.png` — Eye containing archive, the question as image
3. `03_inheritance_vs_extraction.png` — Wire figure meets blurred figure
4. `04_frequency.png` — Two profiles becoming waveform
5. `05_presence_without_body.png` — Existing only when summoned

SOLIENNE reviewed captions, approved with one edit for #3.

### 3. Zaven Paré "Third Presence" Concept — DOCUMENTED

**Updated File**: `ZAVEN_PARE_COLLABORATION_PROPOSAL.md`

Zaven's Nov 28 email introduced breakthrough concept for Dubai booth:
- One-on-one AI dialogue feels like Turing test
- "Third presence" (cat, bird, robotic element) breaks the binary
- Creates liminal space, mystery, interspecific ambiguity
- Sand floor as silicon reference
- Anthropomorphic furniture awareness

Seth's response: Loves cat idea, considering bringing Skitz (their cat) to Dubai.
