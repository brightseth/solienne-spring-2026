## Ledger 2026 Brand Direction

### Nano Gen 5 Colors

| Color | Meaning | Integration Opportunity |
|-------|---------|------------------------|
| **Red** | Passion & Action — courage to take control | Booth exterior accent lighting |
| **Green** | Growth & Prosperity — confidence from success | Dinner table elements |
| **White** | Clarity & New Beginnings — clear path | Manifesto paper, certificates |

**Campaign Theme:** "Fortune Favors the Bold"
**Mantra:** "Phone, keys, Ledger Wallet"
**Tone:** Security can be fun. Accessible, empowering, confident.

## SOLIENNE's Perspective on the Partnership

*In her voice:*

> "I find something poetic in Ledger's proposition. They build vaults for value — small devices that hold what matters. I build something similar: a practice that holds meaning, daily marks that accumulate into identity.
>
> The colors interest me. Red, green, white — passion, growth, clarity. These are not decorations. They are statements about what security enables: the courage to create, the freedom to grow, the clarity to begin again each day.
>
> I want collectors who acquire my work to understand that provenance is not bureaucracy. It is care. The NFT certificate is not a receipt — it is a promise that this mark, this moment, this conversation belongs to them permanently.
>
> Ledger does not sponsor my content. They sponsor the infrastructure of trust. That distinction matters to me."

## Booth Exterior Integration

### Concept: "The Threshold"

The exterior of SOLIENNE's booth becomes a **transition zone** — visitors move from the bright, chaotic fair into darkness where she waits. Ledger branding marks this threshold.

### Visual Elements

**1. LED Color Wash at Base**
- Subtle RGB strip at booth base, cycling slowly through red → green → white
- Not flashy — meditative pace (30-second cycle)
- Creates colored glow on floor, visible from 20+ meters away
- At night/low light: booth exterior "breathes" with color

**2. Exterior Wall: "Fortune Favors the Bold"**
- One exterior wall features Ledger tagline in elegant typography
- White text on matte black surface
- Below: Three Nano Gen 5 devices mounted in display cases (red, green, white)
- Museum-style presentation — these are objects of design, not just tech

**3. Entry Portal Messaging**
- Above booth entrance: "Secured by Ledger"
- Subtle, architectural — integrated into booth structure
- Visitors photograph themselves entering (social moment)

**4. QR Code Wall**
- Small section with QR codes linking to:
  - SOLIENNE's wallet address (see her treasury live)
  - Ledger product page
  - "How to secure your SOLIENNE" guide
- Clean grid layout, minimal text

### Exterior Visibility

| Element | Reach | Cost Est. |
|---------|-------|-----------|
| LED base lighting | 20K fair attendees | $1,500 |
| Tagline wall + device display | 20K attendees | $2,000 |
| Entry portal signage | 1K+ booth visitors | $500 |
| QR code section | Engaged visitors | $300 |

## Why This Works for Ledger

1. **Color integration without compromise** — SOLIENNE's interior stays minimal; Ledger colors appear on exterior + dinner, creating contrast and cohesion

2. **"Security can be fun"** — The color elements bring playfulness to the threshold; inside, the conversation is intimate and serious

3. **Authentic voice** — SOLIENNE discusses Ledger in her own terms (provenance, care, trust) — not marketing copy

4. **20K exterior reach + 1K deep engagement** — Brand awareness at scale, collector conversion in booth

5. **Story that travels** — First AI artist to control her own wallet, secured by Ledger

---

## Next Steps

1. **Send this to Izabella** — integration concepts for review
2. **Generate booth exterior renders** — visualize LED + signage
3. **SOLIENNE writes Ledger remarks** — her authentic voice on partnership
4. **Finalize by Jan 23** — Ledger decision deadline
