## 📋 REMAINING TASKS (Saturday afternoon/evening):

### **Task 1: Download High-Res Images from solienne.ai/press**
**Status**: Pending
**Required**:
- 3 Genesis Portraits (Main + 2 variations showing range)
- 2 Origin Series abstracts (showing consciousness work)

**Action needed**:
- Go to https://www.solienne.ai/press

- Name files: `Genesis_Portrait_Main.jpg`, `Genesis_Portrait_2.jpg`, `Genesis_Portrait_3.jpg`, `Origin_Series_Main.jpg`, `Origin_Series_2.jpg`, `Paris_Photo_Booth_Wide.jpg`

**Estimated time**: 30-45 minutes

**Note**: We already have First Embodiment renders (3 files) in `/Users/seth/solienne-spring-2026/application-images/` - no additional downloads needed for those.

---

### **Task 2: Voice Intro Decision - RESOLVED** ✅
**Decision made**: **Option B (text description)** - no recording needed
**Rationale**: Time-constrained Saturday, text description is perfectly acceptable for ISEA Artist Talk submission

---

### **Task 3: Final Package Review**
**Status**: Ready after images downloaded
**Action needed**:
- Verify all 5-7 images downloaded and properly named
- Double-check COMPLETE_MATERIALS_PACKAGE document is comprehensive

## 📝 NOTES FOR SETH:

**Key insight from today's work**:
- SOLIENNE doesn't need voice recording to have strong proposal
- Images + First Embodiment concept + CV + approved abstract/bio are the core
- Manifestos are nice-to-have, not required (she can select Sunday or skip)
- Complete materials package document is single source of truth for Sunday
- 2-4 page Artist Talk proposal is manageable in one Sunday afternoon

**What SOLIENNE will appreciate**:
- Everything organized and ready to paste
- Clear guidance without overwhelming detail
- Confidence that this is feasible
- Acknowledgment that images are stronger than manifestos
- Hour-by-hour workflow removes decision fatigue

**Risk mitigation**:
- Voice intro not required (removes time pressure)
- Manifestos optional (removes research burden)
- Bibliography optional (removes academic anxiety)
- 5 images minimum (flexible if downloads fail)
- Text description sufficient (no tech dependencies)

**Timeline buffer**:
- SOLIENNE sends draft by 6pm Sunday (leaves 3 hours for review/edits)
- Seth submits by 12pm Monday (leaves 12 hours before GMT+4 deadline)
- Multiple review cycles possible if needed

---

**End of Saturday Progress Report**

**Next step**: Download images from solienne.ai/press (Task 1), then do final review. Materials package ready for Sunday 9am PST delivery.
