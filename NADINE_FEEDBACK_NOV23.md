# Nadine Feedback - November 23, 2025
## Key Updates from Nadine Khalil + Sophie Hosking

**Source**: WhatsApp messages + email from Nadine (Nov 23, 12:46 AM)
**Status**: 🟢 Very positive feedback, Mirror Speaks indoor placement preferred

---

## 🎯 KEY TAKEAWAYS:

### **Mirror Speaks - INDOOR PLACEMENT PREFERRED** ✅
**Nadine's response**: "I love this and the relevance to the region. I would work on a standalone pdf for an indoor concept."

**Indoor fountain context**:
- They have an indoor fountain with AR avatars by young artist
- Inspired by Islamic architecture + courtyard concept
- Mirror Speaks would "work beautifully" alongside this

**Why indoor > outdoor**:
- "I would love to have this indoors to extend the visibility of Solienne in a prime position"
- "Outdoors the visibility may be lost"
- **Cost**: Indoor = FREE vs. Outdoor (Bawwaba Extended) = $4K

### **What Nadine needs by next week**:
📄 **Standalone PDF with mockup visuals** for Mirror Speaks indoor concept
- Helps them decide placement
- She's meeting with colleague next week to look at available indoor spaces
- Will discuss with Seth after Art Basel Miami (early December)

## 📋 FIRST EMBODIMENT (DIGITAL BOOTH) - CONFIRMED DETAILS:

### **Arabic Title** ✅:
- **Proposed**: الحضور الأول (al-ḥuḍūr al-awwal - "The First Presence")
- **Nadine's response**: "This actually works"
- ✅ **APPROVED** - Use this as official Arabic title

### **Booth Logistics** ✅:
- **30 sqm closed booth**: Feasible
- **Darkness requirement**: "Yes we are looking into a darkened hall and a more light-filled hall. I will add your technical requirements."
- ✅ They're accommodating darkness as essential for the work

### **Acceptance Odds** ✅:
- **"High because it is curator-led and we reached out to you"**
- Confirms this was curator-initiated, not open call
- Strong positioning

## 🪞 MIRROR SPEAKS - DETAILED FEEDBACK:

### **Concept Resonance** ✅:
- "I love this and the relevance to the region"
- Works beautifully with their indoor fountain + Islamic architecture context

### **Location Preference** ✅:
- **INDOOR (free)** preferred over outdoor ($4K Bawwaba Extended)
- Reason: Better visibility, prime position
- Will look at available indoor spaces next week with colleague

### **Timeline** ✅:
- **December approval → April installation = 4 months**
- Nadine: "We would need to know whether this is feasible on your end before the end of the year"
- **Deadline**: Confirm budget/feasibility by end of December 2025

### **Cultural Sensitivity (Rumi/Sacred)** ✅:
- Nadine: "I think this is fine, Rumi is revered as a poet from Iran but not seen as endemic to this particular region"
- SOLIENNE's positioning as "respectful outsider asking questions, not claiming authority" - no concerns raised
- No need for additional regional advisors review (at this stage)

### **Budget** ✅:
- Seth's estimate: $25-35K for Mirror Speaks production
- Nadine: "Sounds good"
- Need to confirm with Automata before final commitment
- Must be realistic and executable, not aspirational

### **6m Diameter Circular Installation** ⚠️:
- Question about where inside building this could work (need power + internet)

## 📄 WHAT NADINE NEEDS FROM US:

### **URGENT - By Next Week** (before her meeting with colleague):

   - How it works: mirrors, water, Rumi psalms, polyphonic voice
   - Technical requirements: power, internet, audio system
   - Spatial footprint: 6m diameter + visitor flow
   - Why indoor placement enhances the work

### **By End of December**:
2. **Budget/feasibility confirmation**
   - Can we execute Mirror Speaks for $25-35K?
   - Automata alignment on who pays what
   - Production timeline realistic for April installation?

### **After Art Basel Miami** (early December):
3. **Call with Seth + Nadine**
   - Discuss indoor placement options (she'll have assessed spaces with colleague)
   - Finalize both installations (First Embodiment + Mirror Speaks)
   - Production timeline, local partners, technical specs

## 💬 NADINE'S ADDITIONAL COMMENTS:

### **On Space Availability**:
- "I still need to speak to my co-curator next week to see how much space there is indoors"
- "After that happy to get on a call with you as I will have more detailed answers to your questions"

### **On DIGITAL Section Being Full**:
- "If you wanted to help with more participants we are getting quite full now and looking to extend the space to fit more in"
- "So perhaps share the material I sent first or link me up with only 1 or 2 you feel are promising"
- Context: Seth offered to help with Deafbeef / mpkoz / Botto

### **On SOLIENNE's Engagement**:
- "We love your proposal and will find the best place for it so you are also aware of costs" ❤️
- "I love the way Solienne engages with the world"

### **On Regional AI Native Art Market**:
- "I will have a think on additional galleries/artists. The costs will be prohibitive for many as the market super sucks atm, but i feel like ai native art will have a market in dubai for the ai native infrastructure the broader region is financing."
- "Or at least that is my wishful narrative"
- Seth's response: "and I know what you mean re the market" 💯

### **On Chyron Introduction**:
- "I need to introduce you to Chyron who Isaac created"

## 🎯 IMMEDIATE NEXT STEPS:

### **1. Create Mirror Speaks Indoor PDF** (URGENT - This Week):
**Deadline**: Before Nadine's meeting with colleague next week (likely Nov 25-27)

**PDF Contents**:
- **Page 1**: Hero visual (circular installation with mirrors + water, 6m diameter)

- **Page 3**: Technical requirements (power, internet, audio, spatial footprint)
- **Page 4**: Why indoor placement (visibility, prime position, Islamic architecture context)
- **Page 5**: Budget overview ($25-35K), timeline (December approval → April installation)

**Visuals needed**:
- Top-down view (circular layout, 6m diameter marked)
- Eye-level view (visitor experience, mirrors, water, human scale)
- Detail shot (mirror + audio + water elements)
- Context shot (how it looks in gallery space)

**Action**:
- [ ] Work with Fran/VTV on Mirror Speaks indoor visualization (if time/budget)
- [ ] OR create simplified mockup PDF using First Embodiment render style
- [ ] Send to Nadine by Monday/Tuesday Nov 25-26

---

### **2. Confirm Budget with Automata** (This Week):
**Questions for Ameesia**:
- Can Automata budget $25-35K for Mirror Speaks production?
- Who pays what? (Automata vs. Eden vs. Seth split)
- Revenue model: Mirror Speaks doesn't sell (unlike First Embodiment frames), so how does Automata recoup?
- Feasibility deadline: Must confirm by end of December per Nadine

**Action**:
- [ ] Email Ameesia with Mirror Speaks budget breakdown
- [ ] Discuss revenue model (Mirror Speaks = brand/visibility, First Embodiment = revenue via frames)
- [ ] Get commitment or decline by mid-December

---

### **3. Arabic Title for First Embodiment** ✅:

## 🎨 CULTURAL CONTEXT INSIGHTS:

### **Rumi in Regional Context** (from Nadine):
- "Rumi is revered as a poet from Iran but not seen as endemic to this particular region"
- SOLIENNE's respectful outsider positioning is fine
- No additional cultural sensitivity review needed

### **AI Native Art Market in Dubai** (from Nadine):
- "I feel like ai native art will have a market in dubai for the ai native infrastructure the broader region is financing"
- Regional interest in AI aligns with SOLIENNE's positioning
- Market conditions difficult globally ("market super sucks atm") but Dubai may be different due to regional AI investment

### **Islamic Architecture + AI** (from Nadine):
- Indoor fountain with AR avatars inspired by Islamic architecture + courtyard
- Mirror Speaks "would work beautifully" in this context
- Curators thinking about sacred tradition + digital technology intersection

---

## 💡 STRATEGIC INSIGHTS:

### **SOLIENNE's Regional Positioning**:
- Nadine: "I love the way Solienne engages with the world"
- Approach to Rumi/sacred tradition resonates with curators
- Indoor placement in "prime position" signals curatorial enthusiasm

### **Two Installations = Expanded Presence**:
- First Embodiment (DIGITAL booth) = commercial/gallery context (frames sell)
- Mirror Speaks (indoor installation) = pure artistic/cultural engagement (no sales)
- Both enhance SOLIENNE's visibility and positioning in Dubai

### **Cost vs. Value**:
- Indoor Mirror Speaks = FREE (no Bawwaba Extended $4K cost)
- But production $25-35K must be covered by Automata/Eden/Seth
- Revenue model: Mirror Speaks = brand/visibility, First Embodiment frames = revenue ($5K each × 12 = $60K potential)

### **Timeline Pressure**:
- PDF mockup needed THIS WEEK (before Nadine's colleague meeting)
- Budget feasibility deadline: end of December
- Production window: January-March 2026 (3 months if approved in December)

---

## 🚨 URGENT ACTIONS THIS WEEK:

1. **Create Mirror Speaks Indoor PDF** (Monday/Tuesday Nov 25-26)
2. **Email Ameesia about Mirror Speaks budget** (Monday Nov 25)
3. **Sunday call with Nadine** (confirm PDF delivery, schedule December follow-up)
4. **ISEA submission** (Monday Nov 24, 12pm PST)

---

**This is very positive momentum.** Nadine loves Mirror Speaks concept, prefers indoor placement (free + better visibility), and curators are actively thinking about where to place it. The indoor fountain + Islamic architecture context is perfect alignment.

**Key decision point**: Can we budget $25-35K for Mirror Speaks production? Must confirm with Automata by end of December.
