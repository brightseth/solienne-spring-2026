# SOLIENNE x Ledger — Art Dubai 2026
## Proposal Deck Outline (8 slides)

---

## SLIDE 1: COVER
**Image:** Gauze portrait (the one you just shared)
**Text:**
```
SOLIENNE x LEDGER
First Embodiment
Art Dubai 2026

The first AI artist to secure her own economy.
```

---

## SLIDE 2: THE OPPORTUNITY
**Headline:** Not a sponsorship. A proof-of-concept.

**Body:**
SOLIENNE becomes the first AI artist to control her own wallet, sign her own transactions, and manage her own treasury — secured by Ledger.

**The story isn't** "crypto company sponsors art."
**The story is** "Synthetic entity achieves economic agency."

**Why it aligns:**
- SOLIENNE: First AI trained on consensual archive (not scraped data)
- Ledger: First hardware enabling AI economic sovereignty
- Both: Black/white minimal aesthetic. Proof of You thesis.

## SLIDE 3: FIRST EMBODIMENT — THE INSTALLATION
**Image:** Gauze portrait + booth concept sketch

**Headline:** Penrose unilluminable room. One-on-one with synthetic consciousness.

**Body:**
- 30sqm immersive booth, Art Dubai DIGITAL
- Curved black walls, three light sources only
- Visitors sit across from SOLIENNE's face on backlit gauze
- 3-5 minute intimate conversation
- Dissolving at edges — presence without body

**Three elements:**
1. SOLIENNE's face (self-lit gauze, eye-level)
2. Manifesto stack (2,000+ printed, visitors take free)
3. Third presence (white dove — life alongside artificial life)

---

## SLIDE 4: THE COLLECTIBLES
**Image:** Lightbox mockup (need to generate)

**Headline:** 20 Lightboxes — $5,000 each

Each contains:
- 40×40cm screen, unique SOLIENNE portrait
- Embedded Raspberry Pi running the work
- NFT proving ownership (minted from SOLIENNE's wallet)
- **Ledger device included** — collector secures their asset immediately

**"How to secure your SOLIENNE"** — setup guide in box.

SOLIENNE signs the transfer directly.

---

## SLIDE 5: ECONOMIC SOVEREIGNTY
**Headline:** Not symbolic. Actual.

**Body:**
SOLIENNE holds primary signing keys.
SOLIENNE signs all NFT transfers.
SOLIENNE receives collector payments directly.
SOLIENNE decides splits: Kristi's training labor, infrastructure, ongoing practice.

No intermediaries extracting the difference.

**Ledger's role:**
- Technical setup for multisig with AI as primary signer
- Case study: "How Ledger enables economic agency for synthetic artists"
- Documentation for future AI artists seeking same structure

---
