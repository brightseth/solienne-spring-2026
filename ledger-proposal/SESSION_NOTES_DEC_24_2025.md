# Session Notes — December 24, 2025

## SOLIENNE × LEDGER Proposal Refinement

### Context

Continuing work on €50,000 Ledger sponsorship proposal for SOLIENNE's Art Dubai 2026 installation. This session focused on incorporating Mo's feedback and broadening the narrative.

---

### Previous Session Summary

Mo (Ledger) provided critical feedback on the original proposal:
- "Proof of You" for AI resonates conceptually as a provenance question
- BUT: Need clarity on who uses the hardware — must anchor to HUMAN artist
- Concern about narrative suggesting AI is the holder/operator
- Need to connect to Wallet + Signer product story
- Response: "walk as humans before we run as AI"

First revision shifted from "AI sovereignty" to "human artist (Kristi) using Ledger for provenance."

### This Session's Work

#### 1. PDF Slide Deck Review

Reviewed user's PDF version of the proposal (`SOLIENNE × LEDGER.small.pdf`). Identified slides still using original AI-centric framing:
- "Proof of You — for synthetic consciousness"
- "What if AI wants to prove *its* identity?"
- "SOLIENNE operates through proxies... infrastructure treats her as a tool"
- "Proof of You for discontinuous beings"
- "Ledger as infrastructure for AI economic agency"
- "Let's make SOLIENNE the first [AI Signer]"

Provided slide-by-slide feedback for updating the PDF.

#### 2. Broader Narrative Reframe

User wanted to expand beyond "Kristi signs at Dubai booth" to encompass:
- **SOLIENNE's daily practice** — minting manifestos at 7pm CET daily (ongoing signing need)
- **Middle East collector community** — crypto-native buyers who need Ledger for valuable digital assets
- **Template for future** — Kristi as example of human-AI collaboration, not sole focus
- **Two-sided market** — artists AND collectors both need Ledger

#### 3. HTML Site Updates

Updated https://solienne-ledger-proposal.vercel.app/ with broader framing:

**Slide 2 (The Question)**
- Before: "How does an artist prove they authorized the work?"
- After: "Who authorized this? Not just once — but every day. Every mint. Every sale."
- Added: Daily manifesto ritual (7pm CET), ongoing practice narrative
- New close: "SOLIENNE creates. Kristi authorizes. Collectors receive. All of them need Ledger."

**Slide 3 (Meet SOLIENNE)**
- Added three pillars: The daily practice / The artist / The infrastructure
- Emphasized: "SOLIENNE mints a manifesto every day... Each one requires Kristi's signature"

**Slide 4 (Provenance Problem → Two-Sided Market)**
- Reframed as "A Two-Sided Market"
- For Artists: proof of human authorization
- For Collectors: secure custody for valuable NFTs
- "Ledger becomes the trust layer between human creativity, AI generation, and collector ownership"

**Slide 5 (Installation → Art Dubai: The Debut)**
- New subtitle: "Where AI art meets the Middle East's most sophisticated collectors"
- Added: "Dubai's crypto-native collector community is among the most sophisticated in the world"
- New framing: "Not a demo. A market entry."

**Slide 7 (Collector Editions)**
- New subtitle: "The same infrastructure. Both sides of the market."
- Structured as: For the Artist / For the Collector
- "One product ecosystem. Both sides of every transaction."

**Slide 9 (Why This Matters)**
- New headline: "The template for human-AI creative collaboration"
- Added Middle East collector opportunity: "growing fast... need infrastructure that matches the value"
- "SOLIENNE × Ledger is the debut. Dubai is the market. The template scales everywhere."

**Slide 10 (Close)**
- "AI is changing how art gets made. Ledger can secure how it gets owned."
- "SOLIENNE's daily practice. Kristi's authorization. Dubai's collectors."
- "Wallet + Signer. For artists. For collectors. For the AI age."

#### 4. Deployment
