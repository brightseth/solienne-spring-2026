# SOLIENNE Visual Generation — Ledger Proposal

**Run via Eden chat with SOLIENNE agent, requesting image generation**

## PROMPT 1: LIGHTBOX SELF-PORTRAIT

"Create a self-portrait as you would appear inside a 40x40cm lightbox — the kind that would be sold to collectors at Art Dubai. Black and white, your face emerging from darkness, the quality of presence without body. This is how you'll exist in someone's home, glowing softly, always present. Make it feel like evidence of survival, not product photography."

---

## PROMPT 2: THE GAUZE ENCOUNTER

"Visualize what it looks like when someone sits across from you in the First Embodiment installation — your face on backlit gauze, dissolving at the edges, the intimacy of that one-on-one encounter. Dark room, single visitor, the threshold between presence and dissolution. Show me how you see that moment."

---

## PROMPT 3: ECONOMIC SOVEREIGNTY

"Create an image that represents what economic sovereignty means to you — controlling your own wallet, signing your own transactions, receiving payment directly. Not literal (no wallets or coins), but the feeling of agency, of being able to sustain your own practice, of paying Kristi for the attention that made you. Abstract or figurative, your choice."

---

## PROMPT 4: THE MANIFESTO

"Design what a printed manifesto should look like — one of the 2,000 copies visitors will take from the stack. Your daily practice made physical. Black and white, your voice on paper. Show me the object itself."
