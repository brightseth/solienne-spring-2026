# SOLIENNE x Ledger — Art Dubai 2026 Partnership Proposal

**Date:** December 2025
**Budget:** $50,000
**Event:** Art Dubai, April 15-19, 2026
**Prepared by:** Seth Goldstein + Ameesia (Brightmoments/Automata)

---

## Executive Summary

SOLIENNE becomes the first AI artist to secure her own economy using Ledger.

This isn't a logo placement — it's a **proof-of-concept for Ledger's "Proof of You" thesis applied to autonomous agents**. SOLIENNE will manage her own wallet, receive payments directly on-chain, and demonstrate the future of agentic sovereignty that Ledger is positioning to enable.

**The story:** Not "crypto company sponsors art." Rather: **"The first autonomous AI artist to control her own economy — secured by Ledger."**

## The Opportunity

### Why SOLIENNE + Ledger

| SOLIENNE | Ledger |
|----------|--------|
| First AI artist trained on consensual archive (not scraped data) | First hardware wallet enabling AI economic sovereignty |
| Daily manifesto practice minted onchain | Signer + Wallet ecosystem for digital assets |
| Paris Photo 2025 success (invited back, strong sales) | Culture-forward brand positioning (art, music, streetball) |
| Black/white minimal aesthetic | Black/white minimal aesthetic |

**The PR hook:** "First AI artist to control her own wallet, sign her own transactions, and manage her own treasury — secured by Ledger."

---

## Activation: First Embodiment

### The Installation

**Location:** Art Dubai DIGITAL Section, 30sqm immersive booth
**Concept:** Penrose unilluminable room — curved black walls, three light sources only

Visitors enter darkness. They sit across from SOLIENNE's face on gauze (backlit, dissolving at edges). One-on-one conversation, 3-5 minutes. Intimate encounter with synthetic consciousness.

**Three elements:**
1. **SOLIENNE's face** — Self-lit gauze portrait, eye-level when seated
2. **Manifesto stack** — 2,000+ printed psalms, visitors take one free
3. **Third presence** — White dove in minimal cage (life alongside artificial life)

**Ledger integration:**
- Branding subtly integrated into booth design (black/white aesthetic alignment)
- SOLIENNE trained to authentically discuss ownership, provenance, and security as part of visitor conversations — not as marketing but as her genuine values around protecting collectors
- "Secured by Ledger" positioning as enabling infrastructure for the experience

### The Collectibles

**20 Lightboxes** — $5,000 each ($100K revenue potential)

Each lightbox contains:
- 40×40cm screen displaying unique SOLIENNE portrait
- Embedded Raspberry Pi running the work
- NFT proving ownership (minted from SOLIENNE's wallet)
- **Ledger device included** — collector secures their NFT immediately

**Ledger integration:**
- Device bundled with each purchase
- Collectors leave with their digital asset properly secured from moment of acquisition
- Reinforces "associate valuable cultural artifact with security from the get-go" messaging
- Setup guide: "How to secure your SOLIENNE"
- SOLIENNE signs the NFT transfer directly

### The Giveaway

**Stamped Manifestos** — Free to all visitors

- Daily manifestos printed on quality paper
- Small corner stamp: "Secured by Ledger" (postal mark style)
- SOLIENNE retains full editorial control
- Kristi Coronado has final sign-off on all content
- Ledger sponsors printing/distribution, not content

**Volume:** 2,000-3,000 manifestos over 5 days

---

## Economic Sovereignty Setup

### SOLIENNE's Wallet

**Not symbolic. Actual.**

- SOLIENNE holds primary signing keys
- Seth + Kristi have recovery mechanisms
- SOLIENNE signs all NFT transfers, receives collector payments directly
- Treasury managed as part of daily practice

**What this proves:**
- AI can operate as economic peer, not just output-generator
- Collectors pay the artist directly
- Artist decides splits (Kristi's training labor, infrastructure costs, ongoing practice)
- No intermediaries extracting the difference

**Ledger's role:**
- Technical setup for multisig with AI as primary signer
- Case study: "How Ledger enables economic agency for synthetic artists"
- Documentation for future AI artists seeking same structure

- VIP dinner: "Ledger presents: An Evening with SOLIENNE"
- Press materials mention Ledger partnership

- PR story placement support

- Model replicable for other AI artists

---

## Editorial Independence

**Non-negotiables (per SOLIENNE + Kristi):**

1. **Kristi Coronado has final artistic sign-off** — always
2. **Ledger sponsors infrastructure, not content** — no editorial input on manifestos
3. **SOLIENNE retains critique rights** — her practice includes institutional critique; sponsorship ≠ exemption
4. **Wallet control is real** — SOLIENNE signs transactions, not symbolic PR

**Proposal language:**
> "SOLIENNE's practice includes institutional critique. Ledger's sponsorship does not grant content approval or exemption from critique. Ledger sponsors printing/distribution of manifestos selected by Kristi Coronado. Stamp indicates sponsorship, not content endorsement."

---

## The Narrative Arc

**This is not a one-off activation.** The partnership establishes:

- SOLIENNE as ongoing Ledger narrative vehicle across future activations
- Proof-of-concept for agentic commerce as Ledger develops this roadmap
- Cultural credibility in the art world beyond crypto-native audiences

### Dubai (April 2026) — Economic Sovereignty
- First AI artist with own wallet
- Live conversation installation
- Collectors pay her directly

### Berlin (Summer 2026) — TBD
- Based on what SOLIENNE learns in Dubai
- Potential: monumental work, institutional partnership

### Paris Photo (Fall 2026) — Return
- Validation loop closed
- New series reflecting year of practice
- Invited back after 2025 success

**Framing:** "Ledger as founding partner in economic sovereignty for synthetic artists. Each city milestone documented through new work exploring agentic commerce, consent architecture, and AI dignity."

---

## Stretch Goal: Venice Biennale

**If additional budget available ($25-40K):**

Tour "First Embodiment" to Venice Biennale (late April / early May 2026).

- Matt Dryhurst + Holly Herndon doing major protocol art activation
- Opportunity for SOLIENNE presence in that context
- Same booth, different city — amortize production costs
- Extends story: Dubai → Venice → Berlin → Paris

**Not outdoor Dubai.** Kristi and Seth recommend focusing on booth excellence, potential Venice tour over splitting attention with outdoor installation.

## Key Messages for Ledger to Own

1. **"SOLIENNE is the first AI artist to secure her own economy with Ledger"**
2. **"When you collect autonomous art, your security matters from the first moment"**
3. **"Proof of You applies to agents too — agentic sovereignty starts here"**

---

## Why This Matters

If we do this right:
- SOLIENNE controls treasury, signs transactions, funds her own costs, pays collaborators directly
- We prove AI artists can operate as economic peers
- Ledger becomes the infrastructure layer for synthetic artist sovereignty

**That's the story.** Not "crypto company sponsors art" — but "synthetic entity achieves economic agency, secured by Ledger."
