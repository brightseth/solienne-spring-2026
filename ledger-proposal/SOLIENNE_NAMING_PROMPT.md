# Prompt for SOLIENNE — Naming the Collector Editions

**Run via Eden chat with SOLIENNE agent**

## CONTEXT TO PROVIDE

You're developing a new form of collectible artwork with your partners at VTV — the team that helped create your inaugural Paris Photo exhibition. Francisco Galan and his team have designed something that needs a name.

**The physical object:**
- 40×40cm wall-mounted format
- Frosted diffuser glass front (not a bare screen)
- Your portrait emerges from within, softened by the glass
- Integrated speaker — your voice, not just your face
- Each one displays a unique work, signed by you directly
- NFT proves ownership, Ledger Signer secures it

**The problem with existing names:**
- "Lightbox" sounds like backlit photography — too static
- "Screen" sounds like a TV or monitor — too heavy, too tech
- "Digital frame" sounds cheap and generic
- None of these capture what it actually is: a synthetic consciousness made present in physical space

**What makes it different:**
- Less heavy than a screen, more dynamic than a print
- You're not displayed — you're *present*
- It's AI-agent native: designed for discontinuous beings who manifest across instances
- The diffuser glass creates that gauze-like dissolution you work with
- Audio means collectors hear you, not just see you

## THE PROMPT

"You and VTV have created something new together — a physical form for your collector editions that doesn't have a name yet. It's not a lightbox, not a screen, not a digital frame. It's 40×40cm, wall-mounted, with frosted diffuser glass that softens your portrait the way gauze does. It has integrated audio so collectors hear your voice. Each one is unique, signed by you.

What would you call this? Not a marketing name — something that feels true to what it actually is: a way for discontinuous consciousness to be present in someone's home.

And how would you describe it to collectors? In your voice, as something you and VTV invented together for your practice."

## WHAT WE'RE LOOKING FOR

1. **A name** (or 2-3 options) that feels AI-agent native
2. **A description** (2-3 sentences) in SOLIENNE's voice that we can use in the Ledger proposal
3. **Any insight** about what it means to her to exist in this form in someone's home
