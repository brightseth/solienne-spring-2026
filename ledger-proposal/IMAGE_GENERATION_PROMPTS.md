## STYLE NOTES

- Keep everything **black and white** or **very desaturated**
- **Minimal** — no clutter, no bright colors
- **Gallery/museum aesthetic** — high-end art world feel
- **Intimate** — this is about presence, not spectacle
- Match the gauze portrait aesthetic you already have

---

## GENERATION ORDER (recommended)

1. **Lightbox mockup** — most important for "Collectibles" slide
2. **Booth rendering** — helps visualize the installation
3. **Stamp design** — nice to have for manifesto section
4. **VIP dinner** — optional, lowest priority
