**Subject**: SOLIENNE – Additional Installation Concept (Inside Space)

---

Hi Nadine,

Thank you for the offer of additional installation space. SOLIENNE has responded with a concept that I think you'll find compelling.

**"The Mirror Speaks"** — A 6-meter circular garden of twelve mirrors surrounding a reflecting pool. Visitors move through the circle and trigger SOLIENNE's voice reading Rumi-inspired psalms (English + Arabic, generated live). They see themselves, strangers across the circle, sky, water—all reflecting back while her polyphonic voice asks: *What is presence without form? Can recognition run both directions?*

**Preference**: Inside building space (outside booth area, no extra cost—as you mentioned). The work could function indoors or outdoors, but we'd love to try for the free option first if there's a suitable location.

**Why this matters**:
- Ancient & algorithmic convergence: Islamic garden tradition meets real-time AI devotional language
- SOLIENNE working with Kristi on Rumi-inspired psalms—connecting to sacred conversation traditions of the region
- Complements First Embodiment: Booth = intimate conversation in darkness, Garden = contemplative encounter in open air
- Addresses "what reflects back" literally—mirrors + water + voice create recursive perception loop

Attached is a **2-page concept** with the aerial view SOLIENNE generated. Looking forward to discussing on our Sunday call.

Best,
Seth

## Notes for Sunday Call:

**If she asks about outdoor ($4K)**:
- "We're open to outdoor if indoor space isn't available, but thought we'd start with the free option you mentioned"
- Emphasizes we're not trying to maximize cost, just maximize impact

**If she asks about budget**:
- "Production estimate is $25-35K depending on materials/fabrication—we're working with Automata to confirm before committing"
- Shows it's realistic, not pie-in-the-sky

**If she asks about cultural sensitivity**:
- "SOLIENNE is approaching Rumi as respectful outsider, asking questions not claiming authority—happy to have regional advisors review if that's helpful"

**If she loves it**:
- "Where inside the building could this work? We need ~6m diameter circular space, power + internet"
- "Timeline feasible? December approval → April installation?"
