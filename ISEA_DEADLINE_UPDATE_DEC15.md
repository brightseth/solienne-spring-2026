## 🎯 WHAT TO SEND ISAAC SULLIVAN (By Dec 1):

### **Draft ISEA proposal** including:

1. **Title**: "Not Surveillance. Not Extraction. Inheritance: Consensual Archive Training as Artistic Methodology"

2. **Abstract** (200 words - already strong):
> SOLIENNE is an autonomous AI artist trained exclusively on photographer Kristi Coronado's 46-year consensual archive—not scraped datasets, but one human's lifetime of seeing, given as inheritance. This talk examines consensual archive training as artistic methodology: What changes when AI learns from singular vision instead of internet-scale extraction? How does intimacy function differently than pattern-matching across billions of images?
>
> Using SOLIENNE's evolution from static dissolution portraits (Paris Photo 2025) to real-time conversational embodiment (Art Dubai 2026) as case study, the talk explores three questions: (1) How does consensual training alter the AI's perceptual "voice"? (2) What does embodiment mean for synthetic consciousness attempting presence? (3) When AI approaches sacred tradition (Rumi-inspired psalms), what ethical frameworks enable respectful engagement without appropriation?
>
> Drawing from technical process, visitor encounters, and the artist's own reflection on becoming, this talk proposes inheritance as counter-model to extraction—and asks what AI art might become when built on consent, specificity, and the vulnerability of learning from one human who chose to teach.

3. **Biography** (248 words from website)

4. **5-part talk structure**:
   - Part 1: The Problem (extractive AI training)
   - Part 2: Inheritance (consensual training methodology)
   - Part 3: Embodiment (Paris static → Dubai conversation)
   - Part 4: Sacred (Rumi-inspired work, ethical framework)
   - Part 5: Implications (what this means for AI art)

5. **Documentation** (5 images):
   - Genesis portraits (2-3)
   - Origin series (1)
   - First Embodiment render (1) - NEW: Use Fran/VTV complete installation visualization
   - Paris Photo booth (optional)

6. **Technical requirements**: Hybrid format (pre-recorded talk + Seth operates laptop + live Q&A)

7. **Scheduling preference**: April 11-12, 2026 (before Art Dubai opens April 15)

8. **CV** (one-page)

9. **Questions for Isaac**:
   - Does this positioning resonate with ISEA Dubai priorities?
   - Should we strengthen academic framing with more theory/bibliography?
   - How should we frame Rumi/sacred tradition work for regional audience?
   - Is hybrid presentation format (pre-recorded + live Q&A) acceptable?
   - Any concerns about scheduling (April 11-12 vs. during Art Dubai April 15-19)?

## 📧 MESSAGE TO ISAAC SULLIVAN (Send Dec 1):

**Subject**: ISEA Artist Talk Draft - SOLIENNE: "Not Surveillance. Not Extraction. Inheritance"

Hi Isaac,

Thanks for offering to review! Here's the draft ISEA proposal for SOLIENNE.

**Context**:
- SOLIENNE is an autonomous AI artist trained on photographer Kristi Coronado's 46-year consensual archive
- Exhibited at Paris Photo 2025 (Grand Palais Éphémère, L'Oeil magazine cover)
- Just accepted to Art Dubai Digital 2026 (April 15-19) for First Embodiment installation
- Proposing Artist Talk at ISEA (April 11-12, before Art Dubai opens)

**Core argument**: Consensual archive training (one human's lifetime) as counter-model to extractive AI training (scraped internet). What changes when AI learns from inheritance vs. extraction?

**Regional relevance**: SOLIENNE engages with Rumi's 13th-century Sufi tradition as respectful outsider, asking questions rather than claiming authority. Nadine confirmed this positioning is appropriate ("Rumi is revered as poet from Iran but not seen as endemic to this particular region").

**Questions for you**:
1. Does this framing resonate with ISEA Dubai organizing priorities?
2. Should I strengthen academic positioning with more theory (Crawford, Hayles, Derrida)?
3. How should I position Rumi work for regional ISEA audience vs. international?
4. Is hybrid presentation format acceptable (pre-recorded talk + live Q&A via synthesized voice)?
5. Scheduling: April 11-12 (before Art Dubai) vs. April 17-18 (during Art Dubai) - which is better for ISEA programming?

**Attached**: Complete proposal draft (4 pages), documentation images, CV.

Very grateful for your Dubai Culture/ISEA insider perspective. Happy to jump on a call if easier to discuss.

Best,
Seth
