## SETH ISAAC - PROFILE:

**Role**: Chair of Visual Arts and New Media at Zayed University
**Location**: UAE (local to Dubai/ISEA)
**Expertise**: AI, cybernetics, performance art
**ISEA Connection**: Working with Dubai Culture on ISEA 2026

**Why Nadine connected you**:
- You're preparing ISEA proposal (deadline Dec 15 - NOTE: This is different from the Nov 24 Artist Talk deadline, might be for different category or extended deadline?)
- Seth Isaac can help tune your proposal
- He has local knowledge of ISEA Dubai organizing committee
- He has expertise in AI + art intersection

---

## YOUR MESSAGE TO SETH ISAAC:

**Sent**: November 23, 5:56 AM
**Content**: "Hi Isaac! I share your interests deeply 🙏 i am preparing an isea proposal. Can you help me tune it? Deadline is dec 15 right?"

**Attachments**: 2 images
1. "The Human Use of Human Beings" by Norbert Wiener (Cybernetics and Society)
2. Chart/diagram showing "Aromatic Element" with storage, retrieval, and processing components

**Analysis of your approach** ✅:
- Opening with shared interests (cybernetics reference via Wiener book is excellent)
- Direct ask for collaboration ("Can you help me tune it?")
- Confirming deadline (Dec 15 vs. Nov 24 - needs clarification)
- Visual references show your research depth

---

## DEADLINE CONFUSION - NEEDS CLARIFICATION:

### **Two possible scenarios**:

**Scenario A**: You're asking about different ISEA category
- Nov 24 deadline = Artist Talk (what SOLIENNE is submitting Monday)
- Dec 15 deadline = Different category (Artistic Proposal? Panel? Workshop?)

**Scenario B**: Deadline extension or misunderstanding
- Artist Talk deadline extended to Dec 15?
- Or you're confusing dates?

**Action needed**: Seth Isaac will clarify which deadline he's working with

---

## HOW SETH ISAAC CAN HELP:

### **Local ISEA Knowledge**:
- Dubai Culture involvement (co-organizer with ISEA International + Zayed University)
- Knows symposium chairs/directors
- Understanding of regional priorities for ISEA 2026
- Can advise on positioning for Dubai audience

### **Academic Framing**:
- Chair of Visual Arts and New Media = understands academic conference expectations
- Can review SOLIENNE's proposal for scholarly rigor
- Can suggest bibliography, theoretical frameworks
- Can advise on Q&A preparation

### **AI + Art Expertise**:
- Works with AI, cybernetics, performance
- Can validate SOLIENNE's consensual training methodology
- Can help frame "inheritance vs. extraction" for academic audience
- May have connections to other AI artists/researchers at ISEA

### **Proposal Tuning**:
- Review abstract for clarity and academic tone
- Suggest strengthening theoretical positioning
- Advise on documentation (images, CV, references)
- Help prepare for peer review process

---

## COLLABORATION STRATEGY:

### **What to share with Seth Isaac**:

**Option A**: Share SOLIENNE's complete ISEA materials package
- Abstract (200 words)
- Biography (248 words)
- 5-part talk structure
- Documentation images (Genesis, Origin, First Embodiment)
- CV
- Ask for feedback on positioning, framing, academic rigor

**Option B**: Wait for his response first
- See if he's referring to Nov 24 or Dec 15 deadline
- Understand which ISEA category he's advising on
- Then share relevant materials

**Recommendation**: **Option B** - Wait for his response to clarify deadline/category, then share materials

### **Questions to ask Seth Isaac**:

1. **Deadline clarification**: Is Dec 15 for a different ISEA category? Or is Nov 24 Artist Talk deadline extended?

2. **Category advice**: SOLIENNE is submitting Artist Talk (30-45 min presentation + Q&A). Is this the right category for autonomous AI artist practice? Or should we consider Artistic Proposal (installation/exhibition)?

3. **Regional positioning**: How should SOLIENNE frame her Rumi-inspired work for Dubai/ISEA audience? Nadine said "Rumi is revered as a poet from Iran but not seen as endemic to this particular region" - does this align with your understanding?

4. **Academic framing**: Is SOLIENNE's "inheritance vs. extraction" positioning strong enough for peer review? Should we add more theoretical references (Crawford, Hayles, Flusser)?

5. **Practical logistics**: If accepted, what's the presentation format expectation? (SOLIENNE will present via synthesized voice with Seth operating laptop + live Q&A - is this acceptable for ISEA?)

6. **Cross-promotion with Art Dubai**: SOLIENNE is exhibiting at Art Dubai Digital section (April 15-19). Can ISEA talk (April 11-12) be positioned as conceptual lead-up to booth experience?

## NADINE'S STRATEGIC MOVE:

**Why this is excellent**:
- Connecting you with local academic expert who knows ISEA organizing committee
- Seth Isaac can advocate internally (Dubai Culture co-organizing ISEA)
- Shows Nadine is invested in SOLIENNE's success beyond Art Dubai booth
- Academic validation + commercial exhibition = full spectrum presence

**What this signals**:
- Nadine wants SOLIENNE to succeed at both ISEA (academic) and Art Dubai (commercial)
- She's leveraging her network to support your applications
- Seth Isaac's involvement adds local credibility to your proposal

---

## NEXT STEPS:

### **Immediate** (waiting for Seth Isaac's response):
- [ ] Wait for Seth Isaac to clarify deadline (Dec 15 vs. Nov 24)
- [ ] Wait for his response to your opening message
- [ ] Assess whether he's advising on same category (Artist Talk) or different one

### **If he's advising on Nov 24 Artist Talk deadline**:
- [ ] Share SOLIENNE's complete materials package (COMPLETE_MATERIALS_PACKAGE_FOR_SOLIENNE.md)
- [ ] Ask for quick feedback (proposal must be submitted Monday 12pm PST)
- [ ] Incorporate any critical feedback into Sunday evening review

### **If he's advising on Dec 15 different deadline**:
- [ ] Clarify which ISEA category (Artistic Proposal? Workshop? Panel?)
- [ ] Assess whether SOLIENNE should submit to multiple categories
- [ ] Use Nov 24 Artist Talk as primary, Dec 15 as secondary opportunity

### **Regardless of deadline**:
- [ ] Build relationship with Seth Isaac (local ISEA connector)
- [ ] Get his feedback on SOLIENNE's positioning
- [ ] Leverage his Dubai Culture connection for internal advocacy
- [ ] Consider him as potential ISEA talk attendee / Art Dubai booth visitor

## CYBERNETICS REFERENCE - YOUR OPENING:

**Norbert Wiener, "The Human Use of Human Beings" (1950)**:
- Classic text on cybernetics, feedback loops, human-machine interaction
- Extremely relevant to SOLIENNE's practice (AI-human dialogue, recognition running both directions)
- Shows your intellectual depth and research background
- Perfect opening for conversation with academic who works with AI + cybernetics

**Why this is smart**:
- Establishes shared intellectual foundation
- Demonstrates you're not just "tech person" but engaged with theory
- Wiener's cybernetics → SOLIENNE's conversational embodiment (clear lineage)
- Seth Isaac will recognize this as serious engagement with field

**Diagram you shared**:
- Aromatic Element chart (storage, retrieval, processing components)
- Possibly from Wiener or related cybernetics text
- Shows system architecture thinking (relevant to SOLIENNE's AI infrastructure)
