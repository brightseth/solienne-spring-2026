# SOLIENNE Lightbox — Content Guide for Kristi
## Video Experiments for Dubai Frames

**Date**: November 30, 2025
**Hardware**: Francisco Galan / VTV.xyz Lightbox
**Target**: 20 editions @ $15K each

## QUICK SPECS

```
Resolution:    950px × 950px (SQUARE)
Format:        MP4, H.264 codec
Bitrate:       10 Mbps
Max size:      4GB (~2 hours)
```

**Export settings in Premiere/After Effects:**
- H.264
- 950 × 950
- 10 Mbps VBR
- MP4 container

## THE DIFFUSION LAYER

The lightbox has a **fixed diffusing material** in front of the screen. This means:

1. Everything you make will be **softened further** by the physical layer
2. You can work **slightly sharper** than final desired look
3. High contrast survives better than subtle gradations
4. The diffuser **eats mid-tones** — push to extremes

**Fran's note**: *"Since the diffusing material will be fixed, the video itself generates that dynamic between abstraction and figuration."*

## WHAT WORKS

### Dissolution Aesthetic
- Faces emerging from / dissolving into darkness
- Recognition threshold (almost-face, not-quite-face)
- Horizontal motion blur (see render_01)
- Breathing, pulsing, slow transformation

### Technical
- **Black and white** — your signature, works beautifully through diffuser
- **High contrast** — deep blacks, bright whites
- **Center-weighted** — edges blur more through diffuser
- **Slow motion** — gives the diffuser time to work its magic
- **Loops** — seamless loops for continuous display

### Content Ideas
- Portrait dissolving into frequency
- Face forming from static/noise
- Eyes opening/closing across blur threshold
- Breath as light (expansion/contraction)
- Archive images morphing through SOLIENNE's vision

---

## WHAT TO AVOID

- **Crisp edges** — they'll look soft anyway, don't fight it
- **Text/typography** — will be illegible through diffuser
- **Fast cuts** — diffuser creates ghosting, embrace slow
- **Subtle color** — high contrast B&W is your strength
- **Edge-heavy composition** — center your subjects

---

## LOOP LENGTHS

For gallery display, consider:
- **30 seconds - 2 minutes**: Tight, hypnotic loops
- **5-10 minutes**: Slow evolution, breathing room
- **20-30 minutes**: Full meditation, visitors enter/exit at any point

Shorter loops = smaller files = easier to manage

---

## TEST WORKFLOW

1. **Create at 950×950** from the start (don't crop later)
2. **Export at 10 Mbps H.264**
3. **View on phone/tablet** with screen brightness low
4. **Squint** or use frosted glass to simulate diffuser
5. **Send to Fran** for prototype testing this week

---

## NFT POTENTIAL

This format (MP4 H.264 950×950) is **NFT-ready**:
- Each lightbox could include an NFT of its video
- Collectors own both physical object + onchain artwork
- Could mint on Base (SOLIENNE's chain) or Tezos

## RENDERS FOR REFERENCE

See `/dubai-lightbox/` folder:
- `render_01_dissolution_face.jpeg` — Your aesthetic through the diffuser
- `render_02_dark_emergence.jpeg` — Face emerging from pure black
- `render_03_light_square.jpeg` — Abstract light form

These show how your work translates through the physical layer.

---

## NEXT STEPS

1. **Experiment** with 950×950 square video loops
2. **Test** the abstraction ↔ figuration dynamic
3. **Send** promising exports to Fran for prototype testing
4. **Iterate** based on how they look through real diffuser

*The diffuser is your collaborator. Let it soften what you make. Work with the blur, not against it.*
