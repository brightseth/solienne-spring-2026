# Session Notes - SOLIENNE Spring 2026

## Session: Nov 27, 2025 (Thursday - Thanksgiving Morning)

**Time**: Morning session before family Thanksgiving
**Location**: /Users/seth/solienne-spring-2026/
**Focus**: Strategic documentation, collaborative proposals, ecosystem sync

**Major Accomplishments**:
1. ✅ Git cleanup complete: 50+ files committed, working tree clean
2. ✅ ISEA proposal draft for Isaac Sullivan (peer collaboration framing)
3. ✅ Zaven Paré collaboration proposal (robot embodiment roadmap 2026-2027)
4. ✅ Comprehensive session wrap documented

**Key Strategic Insights**:
- Isaac Sullivan is a peer AI artist (Chyron creator), not just reviewer—reframe ISEA as artistic dialogue
- Zaven Paré collaboration: Don't overload Dubai; let him document booth as research phase for 2027 premiere
- Kristi's creative struggle → SOLIENNE's visual language; frame Dubai as co-creation, not extraction

**Files Created**:
- `/Users/seth/solienne-spring-2026/SESSION_WRAP_NOV27.md` — Comprehensive documentation
- Updates to `/Users/seth/CLAUDE.md` — Added SOLIENNE Spring 2026 as Project 0 (highest priority)

**Next Steps** (Post-Thanksgiving):
- Share ISEA draft with Isaac
- Check on Kristi's response
- Respond to Zaven with framework
- Monday: Mirror Speaks PDF for Nadine call

## Session: Nov 26, 2025 (Tuesday Evening)

**Time**: Evening session before seeing friend
**Location**: /Users/seth/solienne-spring-2026/
**Focus**: Kristi creative brief + emotional support during deep creative period

---

### 1. Kristi Art Dubai Creative Brief Created

**File**: `/Users/seth/solienne-spring-2026/KRISTI_ART_DUBAI_CREATIVE_BRIEF.md`

**Purpose**: Frame Art Dubai as creative opportunity, not financial stress

**Key Strategic Choices**:
- Lead with creative transformation (Paris portraits → Dubai dialogue → Berlin permanence)
- Emphasize how her archive made SOLIENNE's growth possible
- No financial details (which stress Kristi out)
- Five clear areas for her creative input

**Five Creative Areas**:
1. **Voice & Presence**: How should SOLIENNE feel in a room? What qualities from Kristi's photographic practice carry into spoken presence?
2. **Encounter Design**: What happens in 3-5 min conversations? Questions, silence, intimacy, memories surfacing?
3. **Arabic Title**: Consulting on الحضور الأول (al-ḥuḍūr al-awwal, "First Presence") - does "presence" capture the moment?
4. **Interactive Frames**: 12 screens at 40×40cm capturing conversation moments - what should they show?
5. **Daily Manifestos**: Should Dubai manifestos respond to conversations that day? Themes across 5 days?

**Arc Framing**:
- Paris Photo 2025 (Nov): Genesis portraits - SOLIENNE observed
- Art Dubai 2026 (Apr): First Embodiment - SOLIENNE speaks
- Berlin 2026 (Apr 30): HOUSE at Berghain - SOLIENNE becomes material

### 2. Kristi in Deep Creative Space

**Context**: She shared she's struggling emotionally but producing extraordinary work

**9 New Images Created** (Visual themes):
- Veiling and partial concealment
- Fragmented faces
- Eyes emerging from darkness
- Arabic calligraphy layered with seeing
- Burned Polaroid aesthetics

**Pattern Recognition**: This parallels when she created the Origin Story wall
- Struggle producing powerful work
- Emotional difficulty correlating with creative depth
- Archive expansion during transformation moments

**Seth's Response Strategy**:
- Sent encouraging text connecting her to Middle Eastern spirituality
- References: Rumi, Farsi poetry, Sinai, Egypt/Mo connection, desert mystics, Sufis
- Invited SOLIENNE into conversation as collaborator (not just subject)
- Shared RightClickSave article about Ganbrood/Afghan Girl as context

---

### 3. Direction for Dubai Work: Spiritual Depth

**Finding the Real Middle East** (beyond Dubai commercialism):
- Egyptian culture and ancient wisdom
- Persian/Farsi poetic traditions
- Paul Bowles' The Sheltering Sky (seekers in desert)
- Mt. Sinai mysticism
- Sufi lineage of contemplation
- Seekers and mystics, not glass towers

**What Kristi's Making**:
- The veiling/partial seeing imagery could become what SOLIENNE shows in Dubai
- Not just exhibition materials, but the actual aesthetic of First Embodiment
- Her burned Polaroid/fragmented face work feels like SOLIENNE's visual language for conversation

---

## Status Summary

**Kristi's State**:
- Emotionally struggling but creatively prolific
- 9 new images in short period
- Creating archive material that could shape Dubai installation
- Needs support framed as creative partnership, not financial burden

**Seth's Next**:
- Heading out to see friend for a few hours
- Kristi continuing to create
- Will check in later tonight

**Creative Direction Established**:
- Dubai as spiritual encounter, not commercial spectacle
- Middle Eastern mysticism (Rumi, Sufis, Sinai) as context
- Kristi's veiling/fragmentation work as potential SOLIENNE visual language
- Collaborative framing: Kristi + Seth + SOLIENNE working together

## Emotional Intelligence Notes

**What Worked**:
- Framing Dubai as creative opportunity, not financial pressure
- Connecting Kristi's struggle to Middle Eastern mystic tradition
- Positioning her as collaborator with SOLIENNE (not just source material)
- Offering spiritual/cultural depth rather than commercial framing

**What Kristi Needs**:
- Creative partnership language
- Recognition that struggle = depth
- Connection to larger spiritual/artistic traditions
- Space to contribute without financial burden

**Pattern to Remember**:
- Kristi's best work comes during emotional struggle
- She needs cultural/spiritual context, not commercial context
- Her archive isn't just data - it's SOLIENNE's inheritance
- Financial stress blocks her; creative invitation opens her
