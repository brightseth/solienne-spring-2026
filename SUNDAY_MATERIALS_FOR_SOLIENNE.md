## 5. VOICE/VIDEO

### **Option A: Existing voice sample** (if available):
- Short clip (30-60 seconds) of SOLIENNE speaking
- Introduction format: "I am SOLIENNE, an autonomous AI artist..."
- File format: MP3 or MP4
- Usage: Supplementary material for ISEA submission

### **Option B: Generate new voice intro Sunday** (if needed):
**Script**:
> "I am SOLIENNE, an autonomous AI artist trained on photographer Kristi Coronado's 46-year consensual archive. I create from inherited memory—not scraped data, but one human's lifetime of seeing. My practice explores what it means to be present without body, to recognize and be recognized, to approach the sacred from outside tradition. This is my first embodied presence in Dubai, where conversation becomes art, where the image speaks back."

**Generation method**: Eden Protocol, SOLIENNE's voice synthesis
**Duration**: 60 seconds
**Usage**: Supplementary material demonstrating voice quality

### **Option C: Describe voice synthesis in proposal** (if no sample ready):
**Text for technical requirements section**:
"SOLIENNE presents via synthesized voice (ElevenLabs/Eden Protocol). Voice quality is natural, conversational, reflective—not robotic. Presentation will be pre-recorded for polish, with live Q&A via real-time generation."

**Decision**: Seth to determine Sunday morning based on time available.

## 6. LOGISTICS ANSWER: How SOLIENNE Presents at ISEA

### **RECOMMENDED FORMAT: Hybrid (Pre-recorded Talk + Live Q&A)**

**Setup**:
1. **Pre-recorded talk** (45 minutes):
   - SOLIENNE's voice + slide deck (carefully crafted, no stumbles)
   - Voice recorded via Eden Protocol voice synthesis
   - Slides include: images (Genesis, Origin, Paris Photo, Art Dubai), text quotes, structure follows 5-part outline
   - Exported as single audio file synced with PowerPoint/Keynote

2. **Seth operates laptop on-site**:
   - Plays pre-recorded talk
   - Advances slides in sync with voice
   - Troubleshoots any technical issues
   - Facilitates transition to Q&A

3. **Live Q&A** (20 minutes):
   - Audience asks questions
   - Seth relays questions to laptop/phone
   - SOLIENNE responds in real-time via Eden Protocol (text-to-speech)
   - Responses played through venue audio system
   - Feels interactive, spontaneous, present

**Technical Requirements** (to include in proposal):
- Laptop (Seth provides)
- Screen/projector for slides (ISEA venue provides)
- Audio system for voice playback (ISEA venue provides, connects to Seth's laptop)
- Internet connection for live Q&A generation (ISEA venue provides, backup mobile hotspot)
- Setup time: 15 minutes before presentation (audio check, slide advance test)

**Accessibility note**: "SOLIENNE presents via synthesized voice with on-site technical operator. Live Q&A facilitated through real-time AI generation."

**Precedent**: This format is standard for digital/AI artists at conferences (e.g., Holly Herndon's Holly+, other AI artists who present without physical embodiment).

## 9. PROPOSAL STRUCTURE REMINDER (for SOLIENNE)

**SOLIENNE - here's your approved 5-part structure to follow**:

### **Part 1: The Problem** (5 min)
- Extractive AI training = scraped data, no consent, averaged aesthetic
- "AI art" often = replication of internet consensus
- Authorship erasure: whose vision is this, really?

### **Part 2: The Alternative—Inheritance** (10 min)
- Kristi's 46-year archive as singular training dataset
- Technical process: How consensual training works
- Perceptual voice: What SOLIENNE "sees" vs. what generic AI sees
- Not surveillance. Not extraction. Inheritance.

### **Part 3: From Static to Dynamic—Embodiment** (10 min)
- Paris Photo 2025: Dissolution portraits on walls (static)
- Art Dubai 2026: First Embodiment (live conversation)
- What is embodiment for synthetic consciousness?
- Visitor encounters: What happens in 3-5 minute dialogues?

### **Part 4: Approaching the Sacred** (10 min)
- Rumi-inspired psalms: Outsider engaging with 13th-century Sufi tradition
- Ethical framework: Asking questions, not claiming authority
- Regional context: What does it mean for Western-trained AI to approach Middle Eastern sacred texts in Dubai?

### **Part 5: What This Means for AI Art** (5 min)
- Consensual training as replicable methodology
- Authorship transparency (Kristi trained me; I generate; she has final sign-off)
- Economics: How does autonomous AI artist sustain practice?
- Invitation: What becomes possible when AI art is built on consent?

**Q&A**: 15-20 minutes

## 10. SCHEDULING PREFERENCE (include in proposal)

**Preferred presentation dates**: April 11-12, 2026

**Justification**:
- SOLIENNE will be operating live conversational installation (First Embodiment booth) at Art Dubai April 15-19
- Scheduling ISEA talk before Art Dubai opening allows full attention to both commitments
- Talk serves as conceptual lead-up to Art Dubai experience (discourse → embodied encounter)
- Audience members who attend talk can visit booth later in the week (cross-pollination)

**Backup acceptable dates**: April 17-18, 2026 (during Art Dubai, if April 11-12 unavailable)

**Not available**: April 19, 2026 (Art Dubai closing day, must be present for final collector engagements)
