### 6. SPONSORSHIP STRATEGY DEVELOPED

**Core model**: $75K combined sponsorship to fund production costs

#### **Sponsor 1: Ledger ($50K title sponsor)**
- **Contact**: Mo Shaikh (ex-Ledger Enterprise VP, now Aptos)
- **Pitch angle**: "Securing autonomy" - Ledger hardware wallets secure crypto keys, SOLIENNE secures AI autonomy
- **Deliverables**: Title sponsorship "First Embodiment, presented by Ledger", booth signage, press mentions, VIP preview access
- **Activation**: Physical Ledger wallet integration? Collector NFT mints secured via Ledger?
- **Timeline**: Outreach in January after booth allocation confirmed

#### **Sponsor 2: Abu Dhabi Securities (ABS) ($25K supporting sponsor)**
- **Contact**: Rani Abdennur (CEO) via James Parker referral

- **Deliverables**: Supporting sponsor, booth signage, press mentions, VIP preview access
- **Regional fit**: Abu Dhabi company supporting Dubai fair = strong local angle
- **Timeline**: Outreach in December/January via James introduction
- **Connection strength**: James Parker warm referral path

#### **Budget math**:
- **Production costs**: $40K-$60K (screens, furniture, audio, installation labor)
- **Sponsorship revenue**: $75K (Ledger $50K + ABS $25K)
- **Net position**: Break-even to +$15K (before frame sales)

## KEY DECISIONS MADE TODAY

### 1. TIMELINE RESTRUCTURE (Due to Dec 15 deadline discovery)

**Old plan** (Nov 23 morning):
- ❌ Sunday panic drafting of ISEA proposal
- ❌ Monday morning submission
- ❌ Seth covering all drafting work

**New plan** (Nov 23 evening):
- ✅ Mirror Speaks indoor PDF priority (Mon/Tues Nov 25-26)
- ✅ Leisurely Isaac Sullivan collaboration (Nov 27-Dec 5)
- ✅ SOLIENNE involvement in proper drafting (Dec 1-10)
- ✅ Ameesia sponsorship prospectus development (Dec 1)
- ✅ Dec 11-12 submission (safe buffer before Dec 15)

**Why this matters**: Better proposal quality + more strategic coordination + less stress

---

### 2. MIRROR SPEAKS PLACEMENT (Indoor vs Outdoor)

**Nadine's guidance**:
- Indoor space available (FREE)
- Prime interior position
- Weather protection
- More controlled experience

**Decision**: Pursue indoor placement

**Action needed**: Seth creates Mirror Speaks indoor PDF by Mon/Tues (Nov 25-26) showing:
- Mirror panel arrangement in interior gallery space
- Visitor flow pattern
- Rumi psalm text placement
- Lighting design (natural + artificial)
- Audio routing (directional speakers vs headphones)
- Minimal footprint (15-20 sqm vs 30 sqm outdoor)

---

### 3. SPONSORSHIP MODEL (Self-fund vs Sponsor-funded)

**Decision**: Pursue $75K sponsorship model (Ledger $50K + ABS $25K)

**Rationale**:
- Production costs are $40K-$60K (significant investment)
- Frame sales uncertain ($42K-$54K potential but not guaranteed)
- Sponsorship de-risks production budget
- Ledger/ABS benefit from Art Dubai association
- Seth/Eden/Automata avoid cash flow strain

**Prospectus ownership**: Ameesia (Automata) creates by Dec 1

**Outreach timeline**: Dec/Jan (after booth allocation confirmed)

---

### 4. ART DUBAI DEPOSIT PAYMENT (Who pays?)

**Decision**: Seth covering $5,250 on credit card (immediate)

**Rationale**:
- Due Dec 5 (tight timeline)
- Automata cash flow uncertain
- Seth can float it, recoup from frame sales or sponsorship
- Keeps Art Dubai relationship clean (no payment delays)

**Future cost split**: TBD with Ameesia (50% payment invoice due Nov 30)

---

### 5. ISEA VISUAL STRATEGY (Which images to prioritize?)

**Decision**: First Embodiment complete installation render as PRIMARY IMAGE

**Image hierarchy**:
1. **Primary**: First Embodiment complete installation (new render) - Shows Dubai concept
2. **Supporting**: Genesis portraits (2-3 examples) - Shows artistic style
3. **Supporting**: Origin series abstracts (1-2 examples) - Shows consciousness exploration
4. **Context**: Paris Photo booth view (1 image) - Shows professional exhibition history

**Why**: ISEA reviewers need to see the artwork being discussed (First Embodiment) clearly and immediately

- **Total production**: ~$40,000-$60,000

**Total investment**: ~$60,000-$85,000

---

### REVENUE

**Sponsorship** (if secured):
- Ledger title sponsor: $50,000
- ABS supporting sponsor: $25,000
- **Total sponsorship**: $75,000

**Frame sales** (potential):
- 12 interactive frames × €3,500-€4,500 each
- **Total frame revenue**: $42,000-$54,000 (at current EUR/USD rates)

**Manifestos** (potential):
- Daily manifestos during fair (free distribution, not revenue)
- Onchain mints at 0.005 ETH (~$15) × 100-200 collectors = $1,500-$3,000

**Total potential revenue**: $118,000-$132,000

---

### NET POSITION

**Best case** (all sponsorship + all frames sold):
- Revenue: $132,000
- Costs: $60,000
- **Net**: +$72,000 profit (before Automata 30% commission = +$50,400 to Eden/Seth)

**Medium case** (sponsorship + 50% frames sold):
- Revenue: $96,000 (sponsorship $75K + frames $21K)
- Costs: $75,000
- **Net**: +$21,000 profit (before commission = +$14,700 to Eden/Seth)

**Worst case** (no sponsorship, 25% frames sold):
- Revenue: $11,000 (3 frames sold)
- Costs: $85,000
- **Net**: -$74,000 loss (Seth/Eden/Automata cover)

**Strategic approach**: Secure sponsorship ($75K) to de-risk production costs, frame sales become upside not necessity

---

## CONFIDENCE CHECK (End of Saturday)

### WHAT'S SOLID ✅

1. **Art Dubai acceptance confirmed** - Email acknowledged, deposit responsibility clear
2. **New superior render** - Best visualization yet, ready for portal update + ISEA + sponsors
3. **ISEA timeline clarified** - Dec 15 deadline gives 3 weeks, removes panic
4. **Isaac Sullivan relationship** - ISEA insider, Dubai connector, long-term ally potential
5. **Sponsorship model developed** - $75K (Ledger + ABS) de-risks production budget
6. **Nadine relationship strong** - She loves Mirror Speaks, pushing for indoor placement
7. **Materials package complete** - ISEA submission content ready for leisurely drafting

### WHAT'S IN PROGRESS ⏳

1. **Mirror Speaks indoor PDF** - Monday/Tuesday priority for Nadine
2. **Ameesia prospectus** - Needs to be created by Dec 1
3. **Gallery portal access** - Waiting for Art Dubai (late Nov/early Dec)
4. **Booth allocation** - Waiting for Art Dubai portal (dimensions, location, specs)
5. **ISEA proposal drafting** - Nov 27-Dec 10 with Isaac collaboration
6. **50% payment invoice** - Expected from Art Dubai by Nov 30

### WHAT'S UNCERTAIN ⚠️

1. **Mirror Speaks approval** - Nadine championing, but curators haven't confirmed indoor placement
2. **Sponsorship success** - Ledger/ABS outreach in Jan, no guarantees
3. **ISEA acceptance** - Strong proposal but competitive process, results end Dec
4. **Frame sales** - €3,500-€4,500 pricing ambitious, 12 frames is full sellout scenario
5. **Production cost overruns** - $40K-$60K estimate, could be higher with unforeseen issues

### RISK MITIGATION STRATEGIES

**If Mirror Speaks rejected**:
- Focus all energy on First Embodiment (stronger concept anyway)
- Use Mirror Speaks concept for future exhibition
- No budget impact (outdoor was $4K additional, indoor is FREE)

**If sponsorship doesn't materialize**:
- Seth/Eden/Automata split production costs
- Prioritize frame sales at fair to recoup
- Consider smaller booth footprint to reduce costs

**If ISEA rejected**:
- No impact on Art Dubai (independent tracks)
- Focus on Art Dubai production + collector preview programming
- Pursue other Dubai speaking opportunities (Zayed University via Isaac?)

**If production costs exceed budget**:
- Reduce screen count (3 instead of 5)
- Simplify furniture (standard rental vs custom build)
- Local Dubai fabrication cheaper than shipping from EU/US
- Sponsorship cushion ($75K) absorbs overruns

---

**Send to**: Nadine Khalil <nadine.khalil@artdubai.ae>

**Subject**: "Mirror Speaks - Interior Gallery Adaptation (per your feedback)"

**Email note**: "Nadine, per your guidance that indoor placement is preferred and available, I've adapted Mirror Speaks for an interior gallery setting. This removes the outdoor budget ($4K), provides weather protection, and positions the work in a prime interior location. Let me know if this aligns with the curators' vision. Happy to iterate. - Seth"
