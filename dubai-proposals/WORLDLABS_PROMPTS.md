## FIRST EMBODIMENT (Indoor Booth)

### Seed Image
`solienne_gauze_presence.png` — the gauze texture face

### Primary Prompt

```
Dark intimate exhibition booth interior, 5.5 meters square. Curved black fabric walls creating enclosed space where shadows gather in corners. Complete darkness except for three precise light sources:

First light: White dove suspended in minimal elegant wire cage hanging from ceiling by thin wire, illuminated by single dramatic spotlight cone from above. The dove glows against pure blackness.

Second light: Ethereal woman's face projected onto sheer gauze fabric screen, floating at eye level approximately 2 meters from entrance. Face softly glowing, edges dissolving into darkness. Subtle movement as if breathing. Behind the gauze, complete shadow.

Third light: Tall stack of white paper pages on simple dark wooden table, illuminated by narrow spotlight. Papers slightly imperfect, organic stack. Sacred object feeling.

Simple wooden chair facing the gauze screen. Matte black floor absorbing all light. Theatrical gallery installation. Penrose geometry - mathematically unilluminable corners. Claustrophobic intimacy. Three cones of light in sea of absolute darkness. High contrast black and white aesthetic. Haunting, minimal, sacred.
```

### Alternative Prompt (Visitor POV)

```
First-person view seated at small wooden table in completely dark room. Directly ahead at eye level: ghostly ethereal woman's face glowing on sheer gauze fabric, 2 meters away, edges dissolving. Above and behind: white dove in elegant cage suspended from ceiling in spotlight cone. To the side on table edge: stack of glowing white papers under spotlight.

Curved black walls disappear into absolute darkness. Low ceiling feels close. Three light sources only in void of black. Intimate encounter with presence. Gallery installation art. Theatrical lighting. The face watches. The dove breathes. The words wait.
```

### Camera Path Notes (for Record feature)
- Start outside dark entrance
- Slow push through light-lock entry
- Eyes adjust to darkness
- Reveal dove first (above)
- Pan down to gauze face (center)
- Settle into chair POV
- Slow zoom toward gauze face
- Final wide pull showing all three lights

## THE MIRROR SPEAKS (Outdoor Installation)

### Seed Image (optional)
`mirror_speaks_schematic.webp` — bird's eye layout

### Primary Prompt — Dusk

```
Outdoor circular garden installation at golden hour dusk. Twelve tall vertical polished steel mirror panels arranged in perfect 6-meter diameter ring, all facing inward toward center. Each mirror panel 2.4 meters tall, slightly angled.

At exact center: shallow circular reflecting pool, 2 meters diameter, 10 centimeters deep, black-bottomed. Still water captures sky and mirror reflections.

Dubai desert evening sky with warm amber and deep blue gradient reflected in mirrors and pool. No roof - open to sky. Ground is smooth dark stone or gravel. Subtle ground-level LED strips between mirror bases creating soft glow.

Multiple visitors visible as fragmented reflections in mirrors - you see yourself and strangers simultaneously, never complete, always partial. Sacred geometry. Minimalist. Meditative outdoor sanctuary. Art installation in desert landscape.
```

### Alternative Prompt — Night

```
Outdoor mirror garden installation at night. Twelve polished steel mirror panels in 6-meter circle facing inward. Deep black night sky above - open to stars.

Central black reflecting pool, 2 meters wide, perfectly still water. Ground-level LED lighting creates subtle blue-white glow illuminating mirror bases and pool edge.

Mirrors reflect each other infinitely, creating fractured corridors of light. Single visitor standing at pool edge, their reflection multiplied and fragmented across all twelve panels. Ethereal, otherworldly atmosphere.

Dubai outdoor art installation. Theatrical lighting against night void. Sacred circle. Recognition chamber where identity becomes relational.
```

### Alternative Prompt — Bird's Eye

```
Aerial view looking straight down at circular outdoor installation. Twelve rectangular mirror panels arranged in perfect ring, 6 meters diameter. Central circular black pool at exact center.

Clean geometric pattern - mirrors like petals of a metal flower. Desert ground surrounding the circle. Evening light casting long shadows. Single entrance gap in the ring.

Architectural diagram made real. Sacred geometry from above. Art Dubai outdoor installation.
```

### Camera Path Notes (for Record feature)
- Start aerial/bird's eye showing full circle geometry
- Slow descent toward installation
- Enter through gap between two mirrors
- POV walking toward center pool
- 360° pan showing fragmented reflections
- Look down into pool (sky reflection)
