# Booth Renders Brief for Francisco
**January 31, 2026 — Need by Feb 7**

## Context
We just sent Ledger (Izabella, their events/marketing lead) an updated partnership proposal. Told them booth renders with Ledger brand integration are coming next week. Need your help making that real.

## What We Need
5-6 renders showing the booth with Ledger branding integrated. These go directly to Ledger's team for approval, so they need to look clean and professional — not final production drawings, but convincing enough that Izabella can share internally.

## The Booth (recap)
- **30sqm**, darkened, curved black walls
- SOLIENNE's face projected onto **backlit gauze** — not a screen
- One visitor at a time, sits across a small table from the gauze
- Printed manifestos stacked somewhere accessible (visitors take one on exit)
- Overall aesthetic: **black and white**, minimal, gallery quality

## Ledger Integration Points to Show
These are the seven touchpoints we promised. Not all need their own render, but the renders should show where branding lives:

1. **Entry** — small Ledger verification point at booth entrance (subtle, like a check-in desk)
2. **Manifesto stamp** — Ledger seal/logo on back of printed manifestos (could be a detail shot)
3. **Live display** — a screen somewhere in the booth showing blockchain confirmations (small, not competing with the gauze projection)
4. **Collector edition area** — where the 20 limited editions ($5K each) are displayed, each paired with a Ledger Nano X
5. **Exit** — where visitors receive their QR-coded witness certificate

## Branding Guidelines
- Ledger logo is black on white / white on black — fits our aesthetic naturally
- **Integrated, not overlaid** — branding should feel like it belongs in the space, not stuck on top
- Think: the way a gallery credits its sponsors on a small plaque, not a banner
- We'll get official Ledger logo files from Izabella but for now use the standard Ledger wordmark

## Renders Needed
1. **Exterior approach** — what the booth looks like from the fair floor, entry visible, Ledger co-branding on signage
2. **Interior wide** — the full room, gauze projection, table, ambient lighting, manifesto stack
3. **Visitor POV** — sitting at the table looking at SOLIENNE through gauze
4. **Collector edition display** — Ledger Nano X devices alongside prints/lightboxes
5. **Detail: manifesto with stamp** — close-up of a manifesto with Ledger seal on back
6. **Floor plan** — overhead view with labeled zones (entry, conversation, manifestos, collector editions, exit)

## Visual References
- The Kristi archive images on the live proposal give the tone: https://dubai-proposals.vercel.app/ledger-jan30.html
- Ethereal, dark, dissolving forms — the booth should feel like stepping into one of those images
- Previous renders you did are in the same folder for reference

## Timeline
- **Feb 4-5**: First drafts (doesn't need to be perfect, just enough to share)
- **Feb 7**: Final versions we can send to Ledger

## Notes
- The framed prints on the outside of the booth that we discussed are still happening — more figurative, portrait orientation, from Kristi's archive. Renders should show frames on exterior walls.
- Budget conversation still open — let me know if you need anything from me to scope this.
