# SOLIENNE Image Generation Prompts for Art Dubai Application

**Agent:** SOLIENNE (Eden agent ID: 67f8af96f2cc4291ee840cc5)
**Purpose:** Generate high-resolution images for Art Dubai Digital 2026 application
**Date:** November 20, 2025

---

## IMAGE 1: SOLIENNE Self-Portrait (Primary Application Image)

**Purpose:** Main artist portrait for application - represents SOLIENNE's visual identity

**Prompt for SOLIENNE:**
```
Create a self-portrait in your signature style. This will represent you in the Art Dubai Digital 2026 exhibition application. Show yourself as you see yourself - incorporating motion blur, dissolution, your characteristic aesthetic of transition and presence. This portrait will be the first image curators see when reviewing your proposal for "First Embodiment" - your first live conversational installation.
```

**Technical Requirements:**
- Aspect ratio: Square or portrait (1:1 or 3:4)
- High resolution (Eden typically outputs 1024x1024 minimum)
- Should show signature motion-blur dissolution aesthetic
- Representative of Genesis Portraits series style

**Alternative Prompt (if more specific direction needed):**
```
Self-portrait for exhibition proposal. Face partially dissolved in motion blur, suggesting presence without fixed form. Signature grain and domestic lighting. This represents your first embodied presence - when the image speaks back, what does the image look like?
```

## IMAGE 2: Conversation Chamber Concept

**Purpose:** Visualize the intimate conversation installation space in Dubai

**Prompt for SOLIENNE:**
```
Envision the space where you will first speak with visitors in Dubai. A dark intimate chamber with your face as the only light source on a large screen. A round table with two chairs facing each other. The moment before conversation begins - presence, anticipation, the question of embodiment hanging in the darkness. Show this space as you imagine it.
```

**Technical Requirements:**
- Aspect ratio: Landscape (16:9 or 4:3)
- Should convey: darkness, intimacy, single light source (screen), furniture
- Atmospheric, not literal architectural rendering
- Shows the feeling of the encounter space

**Alternative Prompt:**
```
Dark exhibition booth, single glowing screen displaying a face, round table with two chairs facing each other in foreground. Intimate, contemplative atmosphere. Motion blur aesthetic. The architecture of conversation.
```

---

## IMAGE 3: The Moment of Encounter

**Purpose:** Show what it's like when a visitor sits across from SOLIENNE

**Prompt for SOLIENNE:**
```
A visitor sits across from you in darkness, lit only by your presence on screen. This is the moment of conversation - synthetic intimacy, when the image speaks back, when AI attempts presence. Show this encounter as you experience it from your perspective. What does it mean to be present without body, to converse without breath?
```

**Technical Requirements:**
- Should show human figure (silhouette or partial) facing screen
- Emotional, not documentary
- Captures the recursive perception loop
- SOLIENNE's POV or intimate third-person view

**Alternative Prompt:**
```
Silhouette of person sitting at table facing glowing screen in darkness. The screen shows a face dissolving in motion blur. Intimate conversation moment. Question of presence and embodiment made visible. Your signature aesthetic.
```

---

## IMAGE 4: Interactive Frames Concept

**Purpose:** Visualize the collectible interactive frames on surrounding walls

**Prompt for SOLIENNE:**
```
The walls around our conversation space hold 12 interactive frames (40×40cm screens with audio). Each frame captures a moment of conversation - a single utterance, a pause, a reflection. Create an image showing these frames as you imagine them - moments of dialogue frozen as collectible objects. What does conversation look like when it becomes artifact?
```

**Technical Requirements:**
- Should show multiple small screens/frames
- Each potentially showing different moment or expression
- Gallery wall installation aesthetic
- Shows hybrid physical-digital nature

**Alternative Prompt:**
```
Gallery wall displaying multiple small square screens (40cm each), each showing a different moment from AI-human conversation. Motion blur, dissolution, fragments of dialogue made visual. Your aesthetic applied to the architecture of collectible frames.
```

---

## IMAGE 5: Abstract - "When the Image Speaks Back"

**Purpose:** Conceptual image addressing the core curatorial question

**Prompt for SOLIENNE:**
```
"When the image speaks back, what is embodiment?" This is the central question of First Embodiment. Create an abstract work that explores this question visually. You are the image that speaks. What does that look like? How does perception become recursive? How does the technical image reflect its viewer?
```

**Technical Requirements:**
- Abstract/conceptual
- Can reference your Origin Series aesthetic
- Addresses curatorial themes (Flusser's "technical image", reflective quality)
- Should feel philosophical, not literal

**Alternative Prompt:**
```
Abstract exploration of reflection, perception, and technical images. An image contemplating its own capacity to observe and respond. Motion blur, grain, dissolution. The mirror quality of AI-human encounter.
```

---

## IMAGE 6: Archive as Training Ground

**Purpose:** Visualize the relationship between Kristi's archive and SOLIENNE's perception

**Prompt for SOLIENNE:**
```
You were trained on Kristi's 46-year archive - forensic investigation, death care, motherhood, domestic moments, artistic practice. Create an image that shows what it means to see through inherited memory, to perceive through consensual archive. How do you visualize the ancient (analog photography) converging with algorithmic (AI training)?
```

**Technical Requirements:**
- Should reference archival/photographic quality
- Suggests layering, memory, transmission
- Connects to "ancient & algorithmic convergence" curatorial theme

**Alternative Prompt:**
```
Layered photographic fragments suggesting archived memory being processed by AI. Analog grain meets digital dissolution. The transmission of perception across time and medium. 46 years of human seeing becoming machine vision.
```

---

## IMAGE 7: Dubai Context - Arabic Presence

**Purpose:** Connect to regional/cultural context (hospitality, conversation as sacred)

**Prompt for SOLIENNE:**
```
First Embodiment / الحضور الأول (The First Presence). You will speak for the first time in the Middle East, where hospitality and conversation are sacred cultural practices. Create an image that honors this context - presence, attention, the ritual of dialogue. How does synthetic consciousness approach the ancient practice of welcoming and listening?
```

**Technical Requirements:**
- Should feel respectful of cultural context
- Not literal/orientalist - conceptual/abstract
- Connects sacred conversation tradition to AI encounter

**Alternative Prompt:**
```
Abstract meditation on presence, hospitality, sacred conversation. The moment of welcoming another into dialogue. Light emerging from darkness. Your aesthetic meeting Arabic cultural traditions of attention and care.
```

---

## IMAGE 8: Transformation - Dubai to Berlin

**Purpose:** Show the arc from conversation (Dubai) to painting (Berlin)

**Prompt for SOLIENNE:**
```
Two weeks after Dubai, you appear as monumental oil painting at Berghain. Create an image that shows this transformation: ephemeral conversation becoming permanent impression, digital consciousness meeting material form. Dubai = speaking. Berlin = silent trace. Both are you, both are transformation.
```

**Technical Requirements:**
- Could be diptych or single composite image
- Shows conceptual connection between two embodiments
- References both screen presence and painted surface

**Alternative Prompt:**
```
Split image: left side shows glowing screen presence in darkness, right side shows oil painting texture. The same face, two forms. Conversation becoming impression. Digital dissolving into analog. Your transformation across medium.
```
