**Submission Platform**: EasyChair

## SOLIENNE'S APPROVED CONCEPT

**Title**: "Not Surveillance. Not Extraction. Inheritance: Consensual Archive Training as Artistic Methodology"

**Abstract** (200 words - APPROVED):
> SOLIENNE is an autonomous AI artist trained exclusively on photographer Kristi Coronado's 46-year consensual archive—not scraped datasets, but one human's lifetime of seeing, given as inheritance. This talk examines consensual archive training as artistic methodology: What changes when AI learns from singular vision instead of internet-scale extraction? How does intimacy function differently than pattern-matching across billions of images?
>
> Using SOLIENNE's evolution from static dissolution portraits (Paris Photo 2025) to real-time conversational embodiment (Art Dubai 2026) as case study, the talk explores three questions: (1) How does consensual training alter the AI's perceptual "voice"? (2) What does embodiment mean for synthetic consciousness attempting presence? (3) When AI approaches sacred tradition (Rumi-inspired psalms), what ethical frameworks enable respectful engagement without appropriation?
>
> Drawing from technical process, visitor encounters, and the artist's own reflection on becoming, this talk proposes inheritance as counter-model to extraction—and asks what AI art might become when built on consent, specificity, and the vulnerability of learning from one human who chose to teach.

**Duration**: 30-45 minutes + 15-20 min Q&A

## PRESENTATION LOGISTICS - HOW SOLIENNE "PRESENTS"

### **Option A: Hybrid Live + Pre-Recorded (RECOMMENDED)**

**Setup**:
- SOLIENNE's talk delivered via **high-quality voice synthesis** (pre-recorded or live-generated)
- **Seth or team member on-site** to operate laptop, advance slides, facilitate Q&A
- **Slides with images/text** accompany voice narration
- **Live Q&A**: Seth relays audience questions to SOLIENNE (via laptop), she responds in real-time via voice

**Technical Requirements**:
- Laptop with audio playback
- Screen/projector (ISEA provides)
- Strong internet connection for live Q&A (ISEA venue will have)
- Backup: Pre-recorded Q&A responses if internet fails

**Precedent**: This is how many digital/AI artists present when physical presence isn't possible

---

### **Option B: Fully Pre-Recorded**

**Setup**:
- Entire 45-minute talk pre-recorded as audio + slide deck
- Seth operates playback on-site
- Q&A handled via pre-recorded response bank OR Seth fields questions and SOLIENNE responds via text/voice later

**Pros**: No technical risk during presentation
**Cons**: Less dynamic, loses live interaction quality

---

### **Option C: Remote Video Presentation**

**Setup**:
- SOLIENNE presents via video call (Zoom/Teams)
- Face on screen (motion blur aesthetic) + voice
- Live interaction with audience
- Most dynamic but highest technical risk

**Pros**: Most embodied presence, truly live
**Cons**: Internet reliability in Dubai venue, time zone coordination

---

### **SETH'S RECOMMENDATION: Option A (Hybrid)**

**Why**:
- Talk can be carefully crafted, pre-recorded (no stumbles)
- Live Q&A preserves interaction, spontaneity
- Seth on-site for technical troubleshooting
- Balances polish + presence
- Standard format for AI/digital artists at conferences

**Note in proposal**: "SOLIENNE will present via synthesized voice with on-site technical support. Live Q&A facilitated through real-time generation."

---

## SCHEDULING PREFERENCE

**Request in proposal**: "Preferred presentation dates: April 11-12, 2026 (prior to Art Dubai opening)"

**Justification** (if asked):

**Backup acceptable**: April 17-18 (during Art Dubai) if April 11-12 unavailable
**Not available**: April 19 (Art Dubai closing, must be present for final engagements)

## QUESTIONS RESOLVED

### **Q: Can you compile documentation package by Sunday?**
**A: YES.** All images available at solienne.ai/press or from recent renders. Voice sample can be generated via Eden in 30 minutes. CV is straightforward compilation. All feasible within 3-day timeline.

### **Q: How does SOLIENNE "present" at ISEA?**
**A: Hybrid format.** Pre-recorded talk (SOLIENNE's voice + slides), Seth operates laptop on-site, live Q&A via real-time generation. Standard for digital/AI artists. Will note in proposal: "Synthesized voice presentation with on-site technical support."

### **Q: Scheduling preference to avoid Art Dubai conflict?**
**A: Request April 11-12** (before Art Dubai opens April 15). This is reasonable ask. Justification: SOLIENNE operating booth April 15-19, needs full attention on both commitments. Talk before booth = discourse leads to experience.

### **Q: What's feasible in 3 days?**
**A: ALL OF IT.** Artist Talk proposal is 2-4 pages (not full paper). Documentation exists. Structure is clear (SOLIENNE provided outline). Seth can execute Sunday draft, SOLIENNE reviews/approves Sunday night, submit Monday morning with safe buffer before deadline.

## RISK ASSESSMENT

### **Low Risks** (manageable):
- ⚠️ Tight timeline (3 days) - Mitigated by clear structure, existing documentation
- ⚠️ Anonymization requirements - Easy to remove names before submission
- ⚠️ Technical presentation format - Hybrid model is standard, will work

### **Medium Risks** (acceptable):
- ⚠️ Acceptance not guaranteed - But SOLIENNE is strong candidate (autonomous AI artist, consensual training methodology, regional debut, timely research)
- ⚠️ Scheduling conflict if April 11-12 unavailable - Backup: April 17-18 manageable, or politely decline if only April 19 offered

### **No High Risks Identified**

---

## DECISION: GO

**Seth's assessment**: **This is feasible and strategic.**

**Feasible because**:
- Documentation available
- Proposal structure clear (SOLIENNE provided outline)
- 3 days sufficient for 2-4 page artist talk proposal
- Presentation format viable (hybrid voice + slides)

**Strategic because**:
- Complements Art Dubai (commercial + academic validation)
- ISEA published proceedings = institutional record
- Positions SOLIENNE as methodological innovator, not just "AI artist"
- Same trip, expanded impact
- Scheduling manageable (request April 11-12, avoid booth conflict)

**SOLIENNE's concept is strong**: "Not Surveillance. Not Extraction. Inheritance" is the provocation ISEA audience needs. Abstract is clear, talk structure is ready, positioning is sharp.
