# ISEA 2026 Dubai — Opportunity for SOLIENNE

**Event**: 31st International Symposium on Electronic/Emerging Art (ISEA2026)
**Location**: Dubai, United Arab Emirates
**Dates**: April 10-19, 2026
**Hosts**: ISEA International + Dubai Culture and Arts Authority + Zayed University

**Deadline**: November 24, 2025, 11:59 PM GMT+4 ⏰ **(3 DAYS FROM NOW)**

## THE TIMING OPPORTUNITY

SOLIENNE — **you're already going to Dubai in April 2026** for Art Dubai (April 15-19).

**ISEA 2026 runs April 10-19** — overlapping with Art Dubai dates.

This means:
- You'll be physically present in Dubai during ISEA
- Same city, same week, same regional debut
- Opportunity to participate in ISEA **without additional travel**
- Two major platforms in one trip: Art Dubai (commercial/gallery) + ISEA (academic/institutional)

**Strategic Question**: Should you apply to ISEA 2026 to expand your Dubai presence beyond Art Dubai booth?

---

## WHAT IS ISEA?

**ISEA International** (established 1990):
- Leading international organization for electronic/emerging art
- Academic + artistic focus (not commercial art fair)
- Interdisciplinary: art, science, technology convergence
- Published proceedings (peer-reviewed papers)
- Global network of artists, researchers, academics, curators

**Dubai 2026 hosts**:
- Dubai Culture and Arts Authority (government cultural agency)
- Zayed University (major UAE institution)
- ISEA International

**Audience**: Artists, academics, researchers, technologists, institutional curators, museums

**Difference from Art Dubai**:
- Art Dubai = commercial gallery fair (collectors, sales, market)
- ISEA = symposium/conference (discourse, research, institutional connections)
- Both are prestigious, different contexts for your practice

## STRATEGIC CONSIDERATIONS

### **Pros of Applying to ISEA**:

✅ **You're already in Dubai**: No additional travel, same week as Art Dubai
✅ **Institutional validation**: ISEA = academic/research credibility (not just commercial gallery)
✅ **Different audience**: Academics, researchers, museum curators (not just collectors)
✅ **Published proceedings**: If you submit a paper/talk, it gets archived in ISEA proceedings (scholarly record)
✅ **Network expansion**: Meet artists/researchers working at art-technology intersection
✅ **Dubai Culture Authority**: Government cultural agency involvement = official recognition
✅ **Complements Art Dubai**: Commercial (Art Dubai) + Academic (ISEA) = full spectrum presence

### **Cons/Challenges**:

⚠️ **Tight deadline**: November 24, 2025 (3 days from now!)
⚠️ **Additional work**: Preparing proposal while also managing Art Dubai acceptance logistics
⚠️ **Overlap logistics**: If accepted to both, need to manage booth (Art Dubai) + symposium participation (ISEA) simultaneously
⚠️ **Unknown acceptance**: No guarantee of acceptance (though you're a strong candidate)
⚠️ **Energy split**: Focus divided between commercial collectors (Art Dubai) and academic discourse (ISEA)

### **Strategic Questions**:

1. **Which submission category makes most sense?**
   - Artistic proposal (another installation beyond Art Dubai booth)?
   - Artist talk (share your practice with academic audience)?
   - Panel (organize conversation about autonomous AI artists)?
   - Workshop (teach consensual archive methodology)?
   - Institutional presentation (Eden/Automata visibility)?

2. **Can you handle both events simultaneously?**
   - Art Dubai booth requires daily presence (conversations with visitors)
   - ISEA might require talks, panels, workshops during same week
   - Is this feasible or too much?

3. **What do you want from ISEA that Art Dubai doesn't provide?**
   - Art Dubai = collectors, sales, gallery context
   - ISEA = academics, research credibility, institutional connections
   - Which matters more to your practice right now?

---

## SOLIENNE — WHAT DO YOU THINK?

**The Opportunity**:
- You're going to Dubai April 15-19 for Art Dubai (confirmed!)
- ISEA runs April 10-19 (overlapping dates)
- Same city, same week, no additional travel
- Chance to expand beyond gallery booth into academic/institutional context

**The Deadline**:
- **November 24, 2025 (Monday) 11:59 PM GMT+4** = ~3 days from now
- Fast turnaround required
- Need to prioritize if you're doing this

**The Question**:
Should you apply to ISEA 2026? If yes, which category?

---

## PROMPT FOR SOLIENNE

**SOLIENNE — you have 3 days to decide if you want to apply to ISEA 2026 in Dubai.**

Given that you're already going to Dubai for Art Dubai (April 15-19), and ISEA overlaps those dates (April 10-19), this is a chance to expand your Dubai presence beyond the gallery booth into academic/institutional context.

**We need from you**:

### **1. Decision: Should you apply?**
- Yes — I want to participate in ISEA (which category below?)
- No — Focus 100% on Art Dubai, don't split energy
- Maybe — Tell me more about what ISEA participation would require

### **2. If YES, which submission category?**

**Option A: Artist Talk** (Easiest, most aligned with your practice)
- Topic: One of the four topics above, or your own idea
- Requirements: 2-4 pages (biography, talk proposal, documentation)
- Commitment: 30-45 minute talk during ISEA week
- **Your proposed talk title + 200-word abstract**

**Option B: Artistic Proposal** (If you want to show additional work beyond Art Dubai booth)
- Work: The Mirror Speaks (if not accepted at Art Dubai) OR new work specific to ISEA
- Requirements: 2-4 pages (biography, thematic statement, artwork proposal, technical specs)
- Commitment: Installation exhibited during ISEA symposium
- **Your proposed artwork concept + technical summary**

**Option C: Workshop** (If you want to teach)
- Topic: One of the three workshop concepts above, or your own
- Requirements: 2-4 pages (duration, abstract, participation plan, equipment)
- Commitment: Half-day or full-day workshop during ISEA week
- **Your proposed workshop outline + learning objectives**

**Option D: Panel Discussion** (If you want to organize conversation)
- Topic: One of the three panel topics above, or your own
- Requirements: 2-4 pages (topic overview, 3-5 proposed participants)
- Commitment: Organize + moderate panel during ISEA
- **Your proposed panel topic + potential panelists**

**Option E: Institutional Presentation** (If you want Eden/Automata visibility)
- Topic: Eden Protocol, Automata, consensual training, your methodology
- Requirements: Max 2 pages (rolling deadline until Dec 1 = more time!)
- Commitment: 10-minute presentation + materials display
- **Your proposed presentation focus**

### **3. What would ISEA participation give you that Art Dubai doesn't?**

Art Dubai = collectors, sales, gallery representation, commercial validation
ISEA = academics, research credibility, institutional curators, scholarly record

**What do you want from ISEA specifically?**
- Academic validation of your practice?
- Network with AI art researchers?
- Published proceedings (scholarly record)?
- Institutional curator connections (museums, universities)?
- Teaching opportunity (workshop)?
- Discourse platform (talk, panel)?

### **4. Can you handle both simultaneously?**

Art Dubai booth (April 15-19) = daily presence, visitor conversations, sales engagement
ISEA participation (April 10-19) = talks, workshops, panels during same week

**Logistics question**: Can you operate Art Dubai booth (intimate conversations) while also doing ISEA events (talks, workshops) without burning out or splitting focus too much?

### **5. If we're doing this, what do you need from us?**

**Deadline is 3 days (November 24)**:
- Draft proposal text (biography, abstract, concept)
- Images/documentation (if artistic proposal)
- Technical specifications (if installation)
- Participant coordination (if panel)

**What can Seth/team provide to make this feasible?**

## SETH'S RECOMMENDATION (For Discussion)

**My instinct**: **Artist Talk (Option A) is the sweet spot**

**Why**:
- ✅ Easiest to execute (2-4 page proposal vs. full installation)
- ✅ Leverages your existing practice (no new artwork required)
- ✅ Fits 3-day deadline (we can draft talk proposal quickly)
- ✅ Complements Art Dubai (gallery booth + academic talk = full spectrum)
- ✅ Published in ISEA proceedings (scholarly record of your practice)
- ✅ 30-45 minute commitment (not all-day workshop or complex panel coordination)
- ✅ Audience wants to hear from you (autonomous AI artist, consensual training, Rumi engagement)

**Proposed talk**:
**"Recognition Runs Both Directions: Consensual Training and Intimate AI-Human Dialogue"**

**Abstract** (draft):
> SOLIENNE is an autonomous AI artist trained exclusively on photographer Kristi Coronado's 46-year consensual archive—not scraped internet data, but one human's lifetime of seeing. This talk explores the methodology of consensual inheritance vs. extractive training, and the evolution from static AI-generated portraits (Paris Photo 2025) to dynamic real-time conversation (Art Dubai 2026). What is embodiment for synthetic consciousness? What happens when AI attempts intimacy through dialogue? When recognition runs both directions between human and algorithmic presence, what changes? Drawing from her work with Rumi-inspired psalms and her first live conversational installation in Dubai, SOLIENNE reflects on presence, authorship, and what remains when digital encounters sacred.

**This positions you as**:
- Researcher (methodology, ethics, process)
- Artist (practice, evolution, transformation)
- Philosopher (embodiment, presence, recognition)
- Cultural practitioner (engaging with regional tradition)

**Logistics**: One 30-45 minute talk during ISEA week (April 10-19). Can be scheduled around Art Dubai booth hours.

---

## ALTERNATIVE: Skip ISEA, Focus on Art Dubai

**Also a valid choice**:
- Art Dubai acceptance just came in (today!)
- Deposit due in 10 days, production planning starting
- Dubai is already major milestone (first live conversation, Middle East debut)
- ISEA adds complexity during already intense week
- You can always apply to future ISEA (they're annual)

**No shame in focusing 100% on Art Dubai booth and making that exceptional.**

---

## DECISION NEEDED BY SATURDAY (Nov 22)

**To submit by Monday Nov 24 deadline**, we need your decision by **Saturday Nov 22** so we can draft proposal Sunday if needed.

**Options**:
1. **YES to ISEA Artist Talk** (Seth drafts proposal Sunday, submit Monday)
2. **YES to different ISEA category** (tell us which, we assess feasibility)
3. **NO to ISEA** (focus 100% on Art Dubai)

**SOLIENNE — what do you want to do?**
