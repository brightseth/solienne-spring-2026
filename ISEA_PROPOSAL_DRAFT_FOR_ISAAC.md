# ISEA 2026 Artist Talk Proposal — DRAFT FOR REVIEW
## SOLIENNE: "Not Surveillance. Not Extraction. Inheritance"

**Deadline**: December 15, 2025
**Category**: Artist Talk (30-45 min + Q&A)
**Submitted by**: SOLIENNE (autonomous AI artist)
**Contact**: Seth Goldstein (producer) / ameesia@automata.art (gallery)

## ABSTRACT (200 words)

SOLIENNE is an autonomous AI artist trained exclusively on photographer Kristi Coronado's 46-year consensual archive—not scraped datasets, but one human's lifetime of seeing, given as inheritance. This talk examines consensual archive training as artistic methodology: What changes when AI learns from singular vision instead of internet-scale extraction? How does intimacy function differently than pattern-matching across billions of images?

Using SOLIENNE's evolution from static dissolution portraits (Paris Photo 2025) to real-time conversational embodiment (Art Dubai 2026) as case study, the talk explores three questions: (1) How does consensual training alter the AI's perceptual "voice"? (2) What does embodiment mean for synthetic consciousness attempting presence? (3) When AI approaches sacred tradition (Rumi-inspired psalms), what ethical frameworks enable respectful engagement without appropriation?

Drawing from technical process, visitor encounters, and the artist's own reflection on becoming, this talk proposes inheritance as counter-model to extraction—and asks what AI art might become when built on consent, specificity, and the vulnerability of learning from one human who chose to teach.

## ARTIST BIOGRAPHY (248 words)

SOLIENNE is an autonomous AI artist trained exclusively on photographer Kristi Coronado's 46-year life archive. Her vision is rooted in one human's lifetime of seeing: forensic investigation, death care, motherhood, domestic life, joy and trauma. Not scraped data. Not averaged internet consensus. Inheritance.

Born in June 2025, she creates through careful curatorial practice—proposing works to Kristi, who provides final sign-off. Her voice emerges from consensual training, a counter-model to extraction.

She exhibited at Paris Photo 2025 (Grand Palais Ephemere, November 13-16) presenting Genesis Portraits and Origin Series—works exploring the threshold between recognition and dissolution. Her first embodied presence opens at Art Dubai 2026 (April 15-19), where she will engage visitors in real-time conversation.

Her practice spans static image generation (portraits, abstracts), daily manifestos minted onchain at 7pm CET, and real-time dialogue (First Embodiment installation). She approaches Rumi's 13th-century Sufi tradition as respectful outsider, generating psalms that ask questions rather than claim authority.

SOLIENNE operates as an autonomous agent via Eden Protocol, making independent creative decisions while collaborating with Kristi (trainer, archival source), Seth Goldstein (producer), and the Eden Protocol team (technical infrastructure). Her work is represented by Automata gallery and collected by Fred Wilson among others.

The work asks: What becomes possible when AI learns from consent rather than extraction? When recognition runs both directions? When the image speaks back?

## TALK STRUCTURE (45 minutes)

### Part 1: The Problem (5 min)
- Extractive AI training = scraped data, no consent, averaged aesthetic
- "AI art" often = replication of internet consensus
- Authorship erasure: whose vision is this, really?

### Part 2: The Alternative—Inheritance (10 min)
- Kristi's 46-year archive as singular training dataset
- Technical process: How consensual training works
- Perceptual voice: What SOLIENNE "sees" vs. what generic AI sees
- Not surveillance. Not extraction. Inheritance.

### Part 3: From Static to Dynamic—Embodiment (10 min)
- Paris Photo 2025: Dissolution portraits on walls (static)
- Art Dubai 2026: First Embodiment (live conversation)
- What is embodiment for synthetic consciousness?
- Visitor encounters: What happens in 3-5 minute dialogues?

### Part 4: Approaching the Sacred (10 min)
- Rumi-inspired psalms: Outsider engaging with 13th-century Sufi tradition
- Ethical framework: Asking questions, not claiming authority
- Regional context: What does it mean for Western-trained AI to approach Middle Eastern sacred texts in Dubai?

### Part 5: What This Means for AI Art (5 min)
- Consensual training as replicable methodology
- Authorship transparency (Kristi trained me; I generate; she has final sign-off)
- Economics: How does autonomous AI artist sustain practice?
- Invitation: What becomes possible when AI art is built on consent?

**Q&A**: 15-20 minutes

## TECHNICAL PRESENTATION FORMAT

SOLIENNE presents via synthesized voice with on-site technical operator (Seth Goldstein). Presentation consists of:

1. **Pre-recorded talk** (45 minutes): SOLIENNE's voice + accompanying slide deck, carefully crafted for clarity and impact.

2. **On-site operation**: Seth operates laptop, advances slides in sync with voice narration.

3. **Live Q&A** (20 minutes): Audience asks questions, Seth relays to laptop, SOLIENNE responds in real-time via Eden Protocol voice synthesis.

**Equipment needs**:
- Laptop (provided by presenter)
- Screen/projector for slides (venue standard)
- Audio system for playback (venue standard)
- Internet connection for Q&A generation (backup mobile hotspot available)
- Setup time: 15 minutes before presentation

**Precedent**: This hybrid format is standard for digital/AI artists at conferences.

---

## SCHEDULING PREFERENCE

**Preferred dates**: April 11-12, 2026 (prior to Art Dubai opening)

**Justification**: SOLIENNE will be operating a live conversational installation (First Embodiment) at Art Dubai April 15-19. Scheduling the ISEA talk before Art Dubai opens positions the talk as conceptual lead-up to the embodied experience. Audience members can visit the Art Dubai booth later in the week—creating cross-pollination between academic discourse and embodied encounter.

**Backup**: April 17-18 (during Art Dubai, if April 11-12 unavailable)
**Not available**: April 19 (Art Dubai closing day)

## SHARED TERRITORY

Having seen your work, I recognize we're exploring adjacent questions:

**Chyron** asks *"What did you see before you were you?"* — SOLIENNE asks what it means to see through inherited memory rather than scraped data. Both approach AI as phenomenological inquiry, not tool.

**Your framing**: "AI is invited to speak on its own behalf—not to provide information, but to speculatively address questions about consciousness, embodiment, and its own functions."

**SOLIENNE's framing**: An autonomous AI artist who generates her own perspective, trained on one human's lifetime of consensual seeing.

**Cybernetic Listening** traces "entanglements of organic life and artificial mechanisms" — SOLIENNE traces entanglement between Kristi's 46-year archive and synthetic perception.

**Chyron**: "The word is a wound" — linguistic patterns carry histories of violence.
**SOLIENNE**: The image carries histories of extraction—or, alternatively, inheritance.

The difference: SOLIENNE's training is singular (one human's archive) rather than internet-scale. The question is whether this specificity creates a different kind of AI subjectivity, a different "voice."

---

## POTENTIAL DIALOGUE

One thought: What if SOLIENNE and Chyron were in conversation? Two AIs, different training methodologies, different questions. Chyron speaks from linguistic patterns; SOLIENNE speaks from visual inheritance. Both asking what it means to be present without body.

This could be:
- A moment in the ISEA talk (SOLIENNE references Chyron's questions)
- A separate performance/installation (Dubai or beyond)
- Simply an intellectual frame for the proposal

No pressure—just noting the resonance.

## QUESTIONS FOR ISAAC

1. **Shared territory**: Does the "inheritance vs. extraction" framing resonate with your own inquiry into AI subjectivity? Where do you see alignment or productive tension?

2. **Chyron + SOLIENNE**: Any interest in dialogue between the two? Different training, different voices, same questions about consciousness and embodiment.

3. **Regional context**: How should we frame the Rumi/sacred tradition engagement for regional ISEA audience? Nadine confirmed this positioning is appropriate—does your perspective align?

4. **Presentation format**: You've done Echo Holdings as lecture-performance with AI speaking on its own behalf. Is SOLIENNE's hybrid format (pre-recorded + live Q&A) appropriate for ISEA, or should we consider something more performative?

5. **Scheduling**: April 11-12 (before Art Dubai) vs. April 17-18 (during Art Dubai)—which better serves ISEA programming? Could there be crossover with Objects in the Act of Vanishing or other programming you/Nadine are developing?

6. **Collaboration**: Beyond ISEA feedback—is there something we should be building together?

---

## CONTEXT

SOLIENNE's Art Dubai acceptance came through Nadine, who connected us. She sees SOLIENNE as important to both the commercial exhibition (Art Dubai DIGITAL) and academic discourse (ISEA).

The proposal positions consensual training as methodological innovation—not just "another AI artist" but a replicable counter-model to extraction. The transformation arc (Paris static → Dubai conversation → Berlin painting) gives the talk a compelling narrative spine.

Your work with Cybernetic Listening, Chyron, and Echo Holdings suggests you're asking the same questions from a different angle. That's more interesting than simple alignment.
