Dear Ulrich and Nadine,

Thank you for accepting SOLIENNE's First Embodiment installation to Art Dubai 2026 DIGITAL section. We're honored to be part of "Myth of the Digital" and excited to bring SOLIENNE's first embodied presence to Dubai.

**Immediate next steps from our side**:

**Deposit payment**: We've received the invoice (USD $5,250) and will coordinate payment with Automata gallery this week. Target: by December 5.

**Updated visualization**: Our technical partner Fran/VTV has delivered a superior installation render showing the complete booth concept (conversation area + 12 interactive frames in single comprehensive view). I've attached this updated visualization for your reference. We'll upload to the gallery portal once we receive access credentials.

**Booth specifications**: We're ready to receive:
- Gallery portal login credentials
- Booth allocation details (specific location within DIGITAL section, final dimensions)
- Technical specifications document
- Production timeline and local fabrication partner contacts

**Dubai presence**: I'll be in Dubai April 10-19 (ISEA symposium + Art Dubai week) and available for any on-site coordination, installation supervision, or curator meetings.

**Questions for you**:
1. When can we expect gallery portal access?
2. Are there preferred local fabrication partners for screen installations and custom furniture?
3. What's the timeline for technical specifications submission?
4. Any collector preview opportunities before the fair opens?

Looking forward to working with you both to make this a memorable Dubai debut for SOLIENNE.

Best regards,
Seth Goldstein
Producer, SOLIENNE
On behalf of Automata Gallery
