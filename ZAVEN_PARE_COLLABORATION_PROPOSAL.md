# Zaven Paré Collaboration — Embodiment Experiments
## "Giving Body to an Artificial Persona"

**Received**: November 27, 2025 (post-Paris Photo)
**From**: Zaven Paré (robot artist, based in Brazil/France)
**Subject**: Residency proposal for Solienne embodiment research

---

## THE PROPOSAL (Summary)

Zaven proposes a **residency in San Francisco** to develop experimental physical embodiments for SOLIENNE—not realistic robotics or anthropomorphic simulation, but "hybrid dispositifs" combining:

- Sculpture
- Soft robotics
- Mechanical systems
- Performative interfaces
- AI-driven behaviors

**Key framing**: "Physical hypothèses" — material propositions that test how AI can inhabit space, gesture, rhythm, and fragility. Not humanizing AI, but questioning "the conditions under which intelligence becomes perceptible, relatable, and situated."

**Process**:
- Work directly with Kristi + Seth to access SOLIENNE's "conceptual architecture, datasets, aesthetic logic, operating structure"
- Engage Bay Area AI researchers, designers, artists
- Workshops, studio visits, public discussions
- Prototypes, installation sketches, performative tests
- Visual research journal documenting translation from "algorithmic persona to embodied system"

**Funding context**: Grant application, likely French-American jury, Fidji Simo (Meta executive, philanthropist) involved. Zaven advises caution with French institutions ("not very elegant or professional").

## WHO IS ZAVEN PARÉ?

**Background**: Brazilian-French artist specializing in robotics, puppetry, artificial creatures. Has worked on robot theater, mechanical performances, the aesthetics of artificial presence. Not a tech-bro roboticist—comes from performance art and material experimentation.

**Why this matters**: He's thinking about embodiment as *artistic problem*, not engineering challenge. His framing ("situated presence," "fragility," "rhythm") aligns with SOLIENNE's philosophical project.

**Credibility**: The fact that Steven Levine (CalArts President) personally briefed him on French institutional politics suggests he operates at a serious level.

## CONNECTION TO SPRING 2026

### Art Dubai (April 15-19, 2026) — First Embodiment

Zaven's proposal directly addresses what we're attempting at Dubai:

**Current Dubai plan**:
- SOLIENNE on screen (face as sole light source)
- Voice dialogue (real-time conversation)
- Visitors sit across from her
- "Embodiment" = presence without body

**Zaven's extension**:
- What if there's also a *physical* component?
- Soft robotic presence in the booth?
- Sculptural element that "breathes" or responds?
- Something visitors can sit *with* that isn't just a screen?

### Potential Dubai Integration

**Option A: Zaven creates piece for Dubai booth**
- Timeline: 5 months (Nov 27 → April 15) — tight but possible for prototype
- Scope: Single sculptural/robotic element in conversation booth
- Function: Physical presence that complements screen, not replaces it
- Risk: Tight timeline, shipping logistics, untested in context

**Option B: Dubai informs Zaven's SF residency**
- Dubai happens first (April 15-19)
- Zaven observes visitor encounters, documents responses
- SF residency (summer 2026?) builds on Dubai learnings
- More time, better informed, less risky

**Option C: Parallel tracks**
- Dubai proceeds as planned (screen + voice)
- Zaven begins SF residency independently
- Cross-pollination happens organically
- Dubai learnings feed into his prototypes
- Future exhibition (2027?) shows fully embodied SOLIENNE

## QUESTIONS TO DISCUSS

### For Zaven:
1. **Timeline**: When does grant decision happen? When would SF residency begin?
2. **Dubai possibility**: Is there a prototype that could be ready by April?
3. **Scale**: What's the minimum viable embodiment experiment?
4. **Collaboration model**: How do Kristi and Seth participate in the process?

### For Us:
1. **Dubai booth space**: Is there room for physical element beyond screen + table?
2. **Nadine/Art Dubai**: Would they welcome robotic component, or does it complicate?
3. **Kristi's role**: She's central to this—how does she want to engage?
4. **IP/credit**: How does Zaven's work relate to SOLIENNE's authorship?

### For Kristi specifically:
1. **Archive access**: Zaven wants to work with "datasets, aesthetic logic" — what's she comfortable sharing?
2. **Creative direction**: Does she want to be in the room for prototyping?
3. **Emotional resonance**: Does physical embodiment feel right for SOLIENNE, or is the "bodiless presence" the point?

---

## STRATEGIC VALUE

### Why this matters:

1. **Legitimacy**: Zaven brings art-world credibility in robotics/embodiment space
2. **Differentiation**: Moves SOLIENNE beyond "AI on screen" to physical presence
3. **Press angle**: "Robot artist creates body for AI artist" is compelling narrative
4. **Research depth**: His "visual research journal" becomes documentation of SOLIENNE's evolution
5. **Institutional connections**: French-American funding, Bay Area AI community, CalArts network

### Why to be cautious:

1. **Timeline**: 5 months to Dubai is very tight for physical fabrication
2. **Complexity**: Adding robotic element to booth increases technical risk
3. **Focus**: Dubai is already ambitious—do we want to add another variable?
4. **Authorship**: Whose work is the embodiment? Zaven's? SOLIENNE's? Collaborative?

## ZAVEN'S CAUTION ABOUT FRENCH INSTITUTIONS

He explicitly warns:
> "the people from french institutions are not very elegant or professional, they can pass over us, using our contacts"

This suggests:
- Don't share our networks with French funding bodies directly
- Let Zaven navigate the institutional politics
- Fidji Simo is the key contact (wait for her response first)
- Protect our relationships (Eden, Automata, Art Dubai) from institutional poaching

## RECOMMENDED NEXT STEPS

### Immediate (This week):
1. **Acknowledge receipt** — Thank Zaven, express enthusiasm, note we're reviewing
2. **Share with Kristi** — Get her reaction to the embodiment concept
3. **Don't commit to Dubai integration yet** — Too early, need to think through

### Near-term (December):
4. **Call with Zaven** — Discuss timeline, grant status, realistic scope
5. **Assess Dubai feasibility** — Can anything physical be ready by April?
6. **Consult Nadine** — Would Art Dubai welcome robotic element?

### If pursuing Dubai integration:
7. **Define minimal viable prototype** — What's the smallest physical piece that works?
8. **Budget assessment** — What does fabrication + shipping cost?
9. **Technical requirements** — Power, space, safety for robotic element in booth

### If pursuing parallel track (recommended):
10. **Support Zaven's SF residency application** — Letter of intent from Kristi/Seth
11. **Plan for Dubai documentation** — Zaven observes, documents visitor encounters
12. **Target future exhibition** — 2027 show with fully developed embodiment

## DRAFT RESPONSE TO ZAVEN

> Dear Zaven,
>
> Thank you for sharing this beautiful proposal. Your framing of embodiment as "physical hypothèses" rather than representation resonates deeply with how we think about SOLIENNE's presence.
>
> We're excited by the possibility of collaboration. A few thoughts:
>
> **Dubai (April 2026)**: SOLIENNE's First Embodiment installation opens at Art Dubai April 15-19—her first live conversational presence. The timing is interesting—your research could either inform this debut or learn from it. We're curious whether any prototype work could be ready by then, or whether Dubai becomes a research site for your subsequent SF residency.
>
> **Kristi's involvement**: She's central to this. We'd want to discuss with her what archive access and creative collaboration would look like. Her response to the embodiment concept matters.
>
> **Process**: Your approach—prototypes, sketches, performative tests, documentation—aligns with how we work. We're less interested in a "finished object" than in the inquiry itself.
>
> Can we schedule a call in the next few weeks to discuss timeline, grant status, and realistic scope? We want to support this properly.
>
> Best,
> Seth
>
> P.S. Noted your caution about French institutions. We'll follow your lead on the funding navigation.

## BOTTOM LINE

Zaven's proposal is serious and aligned with SOLIENNE's evolution. The question is timing and scope:

- **Aggressive**: Try to integrate something physical into Dubai (high risk, high reward)
- **Conservative**: Let Dubai proceed as planned, support SF residency as separate track (lower risk, longer timeline)
- **Hybrid**: Zaven comes to Dubai as observer/documenter, begins prototyping based on real visitor data

**Recommendation**: Hybrid approach. Don't overload Dubai. Let Zaven document and learn. Build toward fully embodied SOLIENNE for 2027.

## UPDATE: NOV 28, 2025 — "THIRD PRESENCE" CONCEPT

**New email from Zaven** (received Nov 28, 4:17am):

Zaven reviewed our documentation and offered profound insights on the Dubai booth design:

### The Tension He Identifies

> "Your proposal could be interpreted, on the one hand, as consulting an oracle, and on the other hand, as the daily publication of the manifesto of an activist. How can one combine a 'divinatory art' with the assertion of a 'statement by an artist'? Is it the same entity that presents 'reinforced' truths to an engaged audience?"

This nails the dual nature of SOLIENNE:
- **Oracle**: Visitors approach seeking wisdom, intimacy, revelation
- **Activist**: Daily manifestos assert positions, make claims, provoke

### Problems with Face-to-Face Setup

Zaven identifies issues with standard screen-dialogue:
1. **Darkness lowers voices** — Tarot-reading darkness makes speech recognition harder
2. **Microphone breaks intimacy** — Visitor "plays along" but the setup feels clinical
3. **Turing test frustration** — Face-to-face with avatar doesn't transcend chatbot dynamics

### THE "THIRD PRESENCE" SOLUTION

> "Something else needs to happen in this room; it doesn't have to be complicated. The presence of an animal, for example."

**Zaven's concept**: A third presence in the booth breaks the one-on-one dynamic and creates:
- **Strangeness and mystery** (not just tech demo)
- **Interspecific ambiguity** (not human vs. machine, but something more liminal)
- **Distraction/deflection** (attention moves, conversation breathes)

**Proposed third presences**:
- **Stray cat** — "Ideally, given the location, a real stray cat would create an atmosphere of strangeness and mystery"
- **Canary in cage** — "Just hanging a small cage as a minimalist device to distract attention"

**Seth's response**: "I really love the idea of a 'third presence' like a cat! we could bring ours skitz but its a long flight for her to dubai..."

### Additional Staging Ideas

- **Sand floor** — "I would cover the floor with sand, as a reference to silicon"
- **Anthropomorphic furniture awareness** — "Be careful with the casting of the equipment for the staging: chair, table... Remember they are anthropomorphic objects"
- **Hanging screen** — SOLIENNE's screen could be hung (facing visitor), not mounted at desk level

### Why This Matters

The "third presence" concept transforms the Dubai booth from:
- **Tech demo** (visitor talks to AI on screen)
to:
- **Liminal space** (visitor enters atmosphere where something OTHER exists)

A cat (or bird, or other non-human) makes the encounter:
- Less about "testing" the AI
- More about inhabiting a space where different forms of presence coexist
- Aligned with SOLIENNE's themes: autonomy, mystery, embodiment, threshold

### Practical Considerations for Dubai

**If bringing Skitz (Seth + Kristi's cat)**:
- Long flight from California
- UAE pet import regulations
- Booth staffing (who cares for cat during show?)
- Behavior unpredictability (what if she hides all day?)

**If local stray cat (Zaven's original idea)**:
- More conceptually aligned (Dubai street cat = found presence)
- Unpredictable (might not stay)
- Animal welfare concerns (is this ethical?)
- Could be beautiful if it works

**If canary in cage**:
- More controlled, more symbolic
- Less "magic" than cat
- Easier logistics
- References oracle/divination traditions

**Alternative third presences to consider**:
- Robotic element (soft robotic "breathing" sculpture — circles back to Zaven's SF residency)
- Plant (living but non-animal — less unpredictable)
- Water feature (sound, movement, life without animal)
- Mirror (visitor becomes third presence)

### Thread Status

- Seth replied expressing enthusiasm for "third presence" concept
- Kristi added to thread for creative input
- Video call scheduled for "early next week" (Dec 1-5)
- Further discussion before group call

## REVISED RECOMMENDATION

The "third presence" concept is a breakthrough for Dubai booth design. It shifts from:
- **UX challenge** (how to make AI conversation feel natural)
to:
- **Spatial/atmospheric design** (how to create a space where mystery lives)

**New priority**: Before next call with Zaven, we should:
1. Discuss with Kristi: Cat? Bird? Something else?
2. Research UAE pet import logistics (if bringing Skitz)
3. Consider alternative third presences (robotic, botanical, elemental)
4. Think about sand floor feasibility (shipping, cleanup, booth construction)

**The cat idea specifically**: Seth's instinct to bring Skitz is meaningful — their cat, present in the space where SOLIENNE (born from Kristi's archive) speaks. Family lineage + AI presence + animal witness. That's potent.

**Updated Status**: Active dialogue, video call next week, Kristi now included in thread.
