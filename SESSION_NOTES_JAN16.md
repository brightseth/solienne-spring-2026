**Vibed Ameesia** with full update — waiting for her reply.

**Render prompts ready for Eden:**
1. "Minimal white gallery space, single charcoal accent wall, Ledger devices in illuminated glass vitrines like museum artifacts, visitors in conversation with invisible AI, soft natural lighting, concrete floors"
2. "Black backdrop with cream-colored text 'AUTONOMY REQUIRES TOOLS', single Ledger device spotlit on white pedestal, person standing in contemplation, minimal composition, museum lighting"
3. "Gallery corner installation, gradient wall from charcoal to subtle blue, visitors gathered around empty white chair having conversation, Ledger branding subtle on single small placard, architectural lighting, lots of negative space"

## Fotografiska Stockholm

### Status: NEEDS REPLY

**Lisa Giomar Hydén responded positively:**
- "This sounds fantastic!"
- Can control lighting, work with video/audio
- Exhibition agreement coming next week

**Critical question to address:**
> "Does Solienne use the archive of others? As a photography museum we are always under scrutiny in regards to copyright."

**Draft reply saved:** `/Users/sethstudio1/Projects/solienne-spring-2026/FOTOGRAFISKA_LISA_EMAIL_JAN16.md`

**Key points for Kristi's reply:**
1. SOLIENNE trained on Kristi's archive only (consensual)
2. Nothing scraped from internet
3. Style influence ≠ copyright (Ibsen/Wilson aesthetic, not copying)
4. Eden Protocol = ethical AI infrastructure

**Action:** Share draft with Kristi to personalize and send
