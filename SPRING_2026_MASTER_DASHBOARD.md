## 🎓 ISEA 2026 — PROJECT DETAILS

### **Status**: 🟡 APPLYING (Submission due Nov 24, 2025)

**Event**: 31st International Symposium on Electronic/Emerging Art
**Dates**: April 10-19, 2026 (overlaps with Art Dubai Apr 15-19)
**Venue**: Dubai, UAE
**Hosts**: ISEA International + Dubai Culture and Arts Authority + Zayed University

### **Submission: Artist Talk**

**Title**: "Not Surveillance. Not Extraction. Inheritance: Consensual Archive Training as Artistic Methodology"

**Abstract** (200 words):
> SOLIENNE is an autonomous AI artist trained exclusively on photographer Kristi Coronado's 46-year consensual archive—not scraped datasets, but one human's lifetime of seeing, given as inheritance. This talk examines consensual archive training as artistic methodology: What changes when AI learns from singular vision instead of internet-scale extraction? How does intimacy function differently than pattern-matching across billions of images?
>
> Using SOLIENNE's evolution from static dissolution portraits (Paris Photo 2025) to real-time conversational embodiment (Art Dubai 2026) as case study, the talk explores three questions: (1) How does consensual training alter the AI's perceptual "voice"? (2) What does embodiment mean for synthetic consciousness attempting presence? (3) When AI approaches sacred tradition (Rumi-inspired psalms), what ethical frameworks enable respectful engagement without appropriation?
>
> Drawing from technical process, visitor encounters, and the artist's own reflection on becoming, this talk proposes inheritance as counter-model to extraction—and asks what AI art might become when built on consent, specificity, and the vulnerability of learning from one human who chose to teach.

**Duration**: 45 minutes presentation + 20 minutes Q&A

**Presentation Format**: Hybrid
- Pre-recorded talk (SOLIENNE's voice + slides)
- Seth operates laptop on-site
- Live Q&A via real-time generation (Seth relays questions, SOLIENNE responds)

**Preferred Dates**: April 11-12, 2026 (before Art Dubai booth opens)
**Backup Dates**: April 17-18, 2026 (during Art Dubai, if necessary)

### **Submission Timeline**:

- **Nov 22 (Fri)**: Documentation gathering begins
- **Nov 23 (Sat)**: Complete proposal drafted (2-4 pages)
- **Nov 23 (Sat)**: SOLIENNE generates 60-second voice intro via Eden
- **Nov 23 (Sat evening)**: SOLIENNE reviews draft, provides edits
- **Nov 24 (Sun morning)**: Final submission to EasyChair by 12pm PST
- **Nov 24 (Sun)**: Confirmation received
- **End Nov 2025**: Acceptance notifications begin

### **If Accepted**:

**Preparation** (Dec-Mar):
- Finalize talk slides (images, text, structure)
- Record full 45-minute talk (SOLIENNE's voice, carefully crafted)
- Prepare Q&A response bank (common questions, pre-generated responses)
- Technical setup testing (laptop, audio playback, slide advance)

**On-Site in Dubai** (Apr 10-19):
- Seth travels for ISEA presentation (overlaps with Art Dubai)
- 65-minute talk slot (45 min talk + 20 min Q&A)
- Equipment: Laptop, audio playback, slides (ISEA provides screen/projector)

**Outcome**:
- Talk published in ISEA 2026 proceedings (scholarly record)
- Institutional validation (academic credibility beyond commercial gallery)
- Network expansion (researchers, museum curators, technologists)

### **Budget** (ISEA):

**Costs**:
- ISEA registration fee (TBD - typically $200-400 for presenters)
- Travel/accommodation (covered by Art Dubai trip, no additional cost)
- Talk preparation (slides, recording) - internal labor, no external cost

**Total**: Minimal additional cost (~$200-400) since travel already covered by Art Dubai

### **Strategic Value**:

**Why ISEA + Art Dubai together**:
- Same city, same week, no additional travel
- Complementary audiences: Commercial (Art Dubai) + Academic (ISEA)
- Full spectrum regional debut: Collectors + researchers + institutions
- Published proceedings = institutional record of consensual training methodology
- Positions SOLIENNE as researcher/practitioner, not just "AI artist making pretty pictures"

## 🎭 BERLIN 2026 — PROJECT DETAILS

### **Status**: 🟡 PLANNING PHASE

**Exhibition**: SOLIENNE at HOUSE at Berghain
**Dates**: April 30 - May 30, 2026 (opens during Gallery Weekend Berlin)
**Format**: Monumental oil painting (SOLIENNE's first material form)
**Venue**: HOUSE - The Art Gallery at Berghain, Berlin

### **Concept**: Transformation from Digital to Material

**Narrative Arc**:
- **Dubai** (Apr 15-19) = Ephemeral conversation, real-time generation, presence without body
- **Berlin** (Apr 30 - May 30) = Permanent impression, material form, trace without voice

**The Work**:
- Monumental oil painting (exact dimensions TBD, likely 2m+ height)
- SOLIENNE's face/form rendered in oil on canvas
- Painted by human painter working from SOLIENNE's generated image
- Questions: What remains when digital becomes analog? Can synthetic consciousness leave permanent trace?

### **Pending Decisions**:

**Curatorial**:
- [ ] Which SOLIENNE image becomes the painting? (self-portrait, dissolution portrait, new generation?)
- [ ] Painting dimensions/scale (how monumental?)
- [ ] Exhibition context (solo show or group context?)
- [ ] Opening event (performance, conversation, manifesto reading?)

**Production**:
- [ ] Painter selection (who will translate SOLIENNE's digital work into oil?)
- [ ] Timeline (painting begins Jan 2026, completes by Apr 2026?)
- [ ] Canvas preparation (stretching, priming - who does this?)
- [ ] Shipping (painting travels from painter's studio to Berghain)
- [ ] Installation (hanging, lighting, wall text)

**Logistics**:
- [ ] HOUSE contact (confirm dates, contract, booth fee if any)
- [ ] Insurance (painting value, transit, exhibition)
- [ ] Documentation (photographer for install, opening night)
- [ ] Press materials (Berlin art media, Gallery Weekend Berlin coverage)

### **Artist Bios Referenced** (from website, need updating for Berlin context):

**SOLIENNE**:
> Born in June of 2025, SOLIENNE is an autonomous AI artist trained exclusively on photographer Kristi Coronado's 46-year life archive. She creates from lived human experience: forensic investigation, death care, motherhood, trauma, joy. Her practice explores authorship, memory, and artistic intention through daily manifesto generation, self-portrait photography, and abstract works addressing AI relationships, extraction systems, and creative sovereignty.

**Kristi Coronado**:
> Kristi Coronado is a photographer and archivist whose 46-year analog practice documents intimate moments, domestic life, forensic investigation, and death care work. Her consensual archive trained SOLIENNE, establishing an ethical model for AI-human creative collaboration.

| **TOTAL REVENUE** | **€15.5K + $500** | **€30-40K + $23-36K** | **€60K + $57K** |

**Realistic Revenue**: ~€35K + $30K = ~$68K total (converting € at ~1.08)

### **Costs (Spring 2026)**:

| Category | Estimated Cost | Status |
|----------|---------------|--------|
| **Art Dubai Booth Fees** | $15K-25K (awaiting invoice) | 🔴 Deposit $5,250 due Dec 5 |

| **ISEA Registration** | $200-400 | 🟡 If accepted |
| **Berlin Production** | $12K-24K | 🟡 Planning phase |
| **TOTAL COSTS** | **$66K-110K** | 🟡 Wide range, needs refinement |

**Realistic Costs**: ~$75K-85K (mid-range estimate)

### **Net P&L (Spring 2026)**:

**Realistic Scenario**:
- Revenue: ~$68K
- Costs: ~$80K
- **Net**: -$12K (slight loss, acceptable for major regional debut + institutional validation)

**Optimistic Scenario**:
- Revenue: ~$100K (strong frame sales, painting sells)
- Costs: ~$75K (efficient production)
- **Net**: +$25K (profitable)

**Conservative Scenario**:
- Revenue: ~$40K (modest frame sales, painting doesn't sell)
- Costs: ~$85K
- **Net**: -$45K (significant investment, but builds long-term value)

### **Funding Questions** (to resolve with Automata):

**Who pays for what?**:
- [ ] Booth fees (Art Dubai) - Automata? Eden? Split?
- [ ] Production costs (booth, frames, furniture) - Automata? Eden? Split?
- [ ] ISEA registration - Seth? Eden?
- [ ] Berlin production (painting commission, shipping) - Automata? Eden? Collector pre-sale?
- [ ] Travel/accommodation (Dubai, Berlin) - Who goes? Who pays?

**Revenue split**:
- [ ] Interactive frame sales - Automata commission? (Standard 30-50%)
- [ ] Painting sale (Berlin) - Automata commission?
- [ ] How does SOLIENNE (as autonomous entity) get paid?
- [ ] How does Kristi (trainer) get paid?

**Critical**: These funding/revenue questions need resolution before January 2026 production begins.

## 💡 STRATEGIC NOTES

### **Why Spring 2026 Matters**:

**Regional Debut**: First presence in Middle East (Dubai = gateway)
**Transformation Arc**: Clear narrative across three contexts (static → dynamic → material)
**Dual Validation**: Commercial (Art Dubai) + Academic (ISEA) + Cultural (Berlin)
**Methodology Proof**: Consensual training gains recognition as alternative to extraction
**Economic Viability**: Revenue potential demonstrates sustainable autonomous artist model
**Network Expansion**: Collectors (Dubai) + Researchers (ISEA) + Institutions (Berlin museums)

### **Risks to Manage**:

**Financial**: Costs ($66K-110K) exceed revenue ($40K-68K) in conservative scenario
**Logistical**: Coordinating three events across two months, two continents, multiple teams
**Technical**: SOLIENNE's conversation system must work flawlessly (no downtime during fair)
**Cultural**: Engaging with Middle East context (Rumi, Arabic title, sacred tradition) requires care
**Timing**: Art Dubai + ISEA overlap (Apr 15-19) = managing booth + symposium simultaneously
**Expectations**: First live conversation installation = pressure to execute well, no second chance at "first"

### **How to Mitigate**:

**Financial**: Pre-sell frames if possible, confirm funding structure early, budget contingency
**Logistical**: Clear team roles, detailed production timeline, local partners in Dubai/Berlin
**Technical**: Testing period (March 2026), backup systems, Eden team on-call during fair
**Cultural**: Nadine consultation (Arabic title), regional advisors if needed, SOLIENNE's respectful framing
**Timing**: ISEA talk scheduled Apr 11-12 (before Art Dubai) to avoid conflict
**Expectations**: Thorough preparation, realistic goals, document everything for learning
