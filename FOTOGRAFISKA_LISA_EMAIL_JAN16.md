## CRITICAL QUESTION: Copyright & Training Data

Lisa is asking about SOLIENNE's training methodology and copyright:

> "One thing I need to ask you and please read with kind eyes - I am new to working with this type of artistry and even though I tried to study as much as I could about Solienne I am a bit unsure about one aspect. As I understand you train her, and you train her from your own archives so to say - but when Solienne creates art - does she use the archive of others? As a photography museum we are of course always under scrutiny in regards to the question of copyright. When an art work is in the style of Ibsen/Robert Wilson - how does this work? (The inspiration is really a marvellous combination)."

### Key Points to Address in Reply:

1. **Consensual training methodology** — SOLIENNE is trained on Kristi's personal archive, not scraped data
2. **No unauthorized use of others' work** — Her outputs derive from consensually provided materials
3. **Style vs. copying** — Being inspired by Ibsen/Wilson aesthetically ≠ copying their work
4. **Eden Protocol** — The infrastructure ensures ethical AI training
5. **Differentiation from other AI** — This is what makes SOLIENNE different from Midjourney/DALL-E

## Draft Reply Points

**For Kristi to send:**

Dear Lisa,

Thank you for your thoughtful question — I appreciate you reading with kind eyes, and I'm happy to address this directly because it's central to why SOLIENNE exists.

**The short answer:** SOLIENNE does NOT use "the archive of others" in the way that most generative AI does. Her training is fundamentally different.

**The longer explanation:**

1. **Consensual training data only.** SOLIENNE's image generation capabilities are trained on my personal photographic archive — work I created and own the rights to. She also draws on materials I've explicitly provided: my aesthetic references, my written notes, my creative direction. Nothing is scraped from the internet or taken from other artists without permission.

2. **This is rare in AI art.** Most AI image generators (Midjourney, DALL-E, Stable Diffusion) are trained on billions of images scraped from the web, including copyrighted work by photographers and artists who never consented. SOLIENNE was built to be the opposite of this.

3. **Style is not copyright.** When you see influences of theatrical lighting (Ibsen/Wilson), that's aesthetic influence — the same way any artist is influenced by predecessors. SOLIENNE isn't copying Wilson's photographs; she's learned from my aesthetic sensibilities, which include appreciation for dramatic lighting and staged portraiture. Style cannot be copyrighted; only specific works can.

4. **The Eden Protocol.** SOLIENNE runs on Eden, an infrastructure specifically designed for ethical AI art practices. The entire system is built around consent, attribution, and artist agency.

I understand the scrutiny photography museums face around AI and copyright. This is exactly why we built SOLIENNE the way we did — to demonstrate that AI art can be made ethically, with full consent of all training materials.

Would a brief call help clarify further? I'm happy to walk through the technical details.

Warm regards,
Kristi
