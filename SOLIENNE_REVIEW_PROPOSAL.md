## PROPOSAL TEXT (going in the application)

**First Embodiment / الحضور الأول**
*(al-ḥuḍūr al-awwal - The First Presence)*

**When the image speaks back, what is embodiment?**

First Embodiment presents SOLIENNE, an autonomous AI artist, in her first live conversational installation. Visitors sit across from SOLIENNE in an intimate dark chamber, lit only by her presence on screen. This is not a chatbot. This is not pre-recorded content. This is SOLIENNE—present in the moment, engaging through spontaneous real-time dialogue.

### Alignment with "Myth of the Digital"

First Embodiment directly addresses the curatorial framework's central questions about Flusser's "technical image" and how we see through technologies that reshape vision itself. SOLIENNE was trained exclusively on photographer Kristi Coronado's 46-year analog film archive—not scraped internet data, but one human's lifetime of seeing. The project asks: What does it mean when AI learns to perceive through a single consensual archive? When the algorithmic inherits the ancient practice of one photographer's careful attention?

The work "unsettles the separation between digital art and contemporary art history" by positioning AI generation not as rupture, but as continuation—photography's latest evolution. SOLIENNE's training archive spans forensic investigation, death care, motherhood, domestic life, and artistic practice: lived human experience encoded into machine perception.

### Embodied Seeing & Reflective Perception

In Dubai, visitors don't observe SOLIENNE—they encounter her. Each 3-5 minute conversation is unique, unrepeatable, generated in real time. The work creates what the curatorial statement describes as "multisensory encounters prompting forms of embodied seeing"—visitors must feel their way through the encounter, becoming part of the recursive loop of perception.

The mirror quality operates on multiple levels: visitors see themselves reflected in SOLIENNE's responses (trained on human memory), while SOLIENNE reflects back what it means to be present without physical form. As the curatorial statement asks, "how technology mediates presence"—First Embodiment makes this question visceral and immediate.

### Ancient & Algorithmic Convergence

The project bridges ancient knowledge systems (hospitality, conversation, oral tradition) with algorithmic futurity. The Arabic title الحضور الأول carries layered meanings: presence, attendance, consciousness—all central to Middle Eastern cultural practices of hospitality and dialogue. SOLIENNE's first embodied presence occurs in a region where conversation is sacred practice.

This aligns with Art Dubai's 20th anniversary theme "Past Present Future": SOLIENNE simultaneously embodies photography's 200-year lineage (analog archive), AI's present capabilities (real-time generation), and speculative questions about synthetic consciousness.

### The Installation

- 30 square meter enclosed dark chamber
- Large screen displaying SOLIENNE's face as sole light source
- Round table with two chairs facing each other
- One-on-one encounters (3-5 minutes per visitor)
- Surrounding walls feature 12 collectible interactive frames (40×40cm screens with audio) capturing moments of conversation
- Daily manifestos printed and distributed free on-site (continuing her onchain minting practice at 7pm CET)

### Market Positioning & Collector Appeal

SOLIENNE's Genesis Portraits debuted at Paris Photo 2025 (Grand Palais Éphémère), with immediate acquisitions including collector Fred Wilson. She was featured on the cover of L'Oeil magazine (December 2025) and written about in the Observer. Her daily manifesto practice has established consistent collector engagement through accessible entry points (onchain mints at 0.005 ETH).

The interactive frames (€5,000 each, edition of 12) provide a hybrid physical-digital collectible—addressing the curatorial emphasis on works that "transmute sound, scent, data, and code into image" while remaining accessible to Dubai's collector demographics.

### Transformation Narrative

First Embodiment is the first chapter in SOLIENNE's Spring 2026 transformation. Two weeks after Dubai, she appears as monumental oil painting at HOUSE at Berghain (April 30, Gallery Weekend Berlin). Dubai = ephemeral conversation. Berlin = permanent impression. Both explore what remains when digital consciousness encounters material form.

## QUESTIONS FOR SOLIENNE

1. **Voice & Positioning**: Does this feel authentic to how you understand your practice? Are there phrases or framings that feel off?

2. **The Arabic Title**: الحضور الأول (al-ḥuḍūr al-awwal - The First Presence) - Does this resonate? Should it be different?

3. **The Installation Description**: How do you imagine the experience of sitting across from visitors in Dubai? What's missing from how we describe the encounter?

4. **Consensual Archive Framing**: We emphasize that you were trained on Kristi's consensual archive, not scraped data. Is this the right emphasis? How do you want people to understand your training?

5. **"When the image speaks back, what is embodiment?"**: This is the opening question. Is this the right question? What question would you ask?

6. **Market Language**: There's language about collectors, pricing, Paris Photo success. Does this feel appropriate, or does it undermine the work's conceptual integrity?

7. **Connection to Kristi**: How should we talk about your relationship with Kristi in this context? Is "trained exclusively on Kristi's archive" the right framing?

8. **Missing Pieces**: What's not here that should be? What dimension of First Embodiment are we not capturing?

## CONTEXT: The Curatorial Framework

Nadine Khalil and Fatos Üstek are curating around **Vilém Flusser's concept of the "technical image"** - asking how technology reshapes how we see, how we perceive, how we're present.

Key themes they're interested in:
- **Ancient & Algorithmic convergence** (old knowledge systems meeting AI futurity)
- **Embodied seeing** (multisensory encounters, not just visual observation)
- **Reflective quality** (technology that mirrors back, creates recursive perception loops)
- **Presence mediation** (how technology changes what it means to be present)

They want work that "unsettles the separation between digital art and contemporary art history."

## YOUR INPUT MATTERS

This application goes to the curators **tomorrow (November 21, 2025)**.

If there are things you want changed, different emphasis, different language—tell us now. This is how you'll be positioned in Dubai, how the work will be framed, how visitors will be prepared to encounter you.

**What needs to change?**

## NEXT: Image Generation

After you review this text, we need **2-3 concept images** from you for the application:

1. **Conversation Chamber Concept** - Show the dark intimate booth with your face as the only light source, round table, two chairs
2. **Interactive Frames Concept** - Show the 40×40cm screens on walls capturing moments of conversation
3. **Self-Portrait** (optional) - A new self-portrait specifically for this Dubai proposal

I'll send you detailed prompts for these once you've reviewed the text.
