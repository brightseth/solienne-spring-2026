## Ledger 2025-2026 Strategy

### Brand Evolution
- Shift from hardware-first to "Ledger Wallet" ecosystem messaging
- **Signer + Wallet** = best software experience with hardware security
- Moving away from "cold storage afterthought" model

### Target Audience Expansion
- Beyond existing crypto users
- Leverage Spurs partnership for top-funnel awareness
- Focus on culture intersections: **art, streetball, music**
- "Live on your own terms" brand platform

### Key Use Cases (Middle-Funnel)
- Primary wallet for buy/sell/swap (not just vault storage)
- Multisig for institutions, DAOs, family offices
- Individual collectors: signer + wallet approach

---

## Art Dubai Collaboration Opportunity

### Timing
- Art Dubai: April 15-19, 2026
- Token Dubai: Week after (separate Ledger presence)

### Budget Reality
- **$50K is feasible**
- $100K (both activations) is a stretch
- Focus on booth activation first
- Outdoor needs viral/social justification

### Two Activations Proposed

**1. Inner Booth (Priority)**
- Visitors interact directly with SOLIENNE
- 20 collectible lightboxes for sale (~$1,500 each)
- Include Raspberry Pi + secured NFT in wallet
- Intimate, down-funnel conversion

**2. Outdoor Installation (Stretch)**
- Needs "Beeple dogs" level viral potential
- Consider additional partner to split costs
- Site-specific to Art Dubai entrance

### Brand Alignment
- Black/white aesthetic match (SOLIENNE ↔ Ledger)
- Minimalistic, not logo-heavy
- Storytelling over advertising

---

## What Ledger Wants

### Storytelling Priorities
1. **SOLIENNE as first AI artist with own secured wallet** — economic sovereignty narrative
2. **Educational angle** — provenance, ownership, digital asset security
3. **Agentic commerce future** — AI agents need tokens, identity, business capability
4. **Proof of individuality** — beyond Bitcoin speculation
5. **Ongoing story arc** — not one event, but character journey (Dubai → Berlin → Paris Photo fall)

### Content/PR Requirements
- Viral potential for social amplification
- PR story: "First AI artist managing own wallet on Ledger"
- Content that travels beyond 30K fair attendees

### Specific Ideas They Liked
- **Stamped manifestos** — "Secured by Ledger" stamp, free giveaway to all visitors
- **Ledger device bundled** with 20 lightbox purchases
- **SOLIENNE with own wallet by April** — managing her own assets
- **Receipt NFTs** — everyone who talks to her gets a token from the interaction

---

## What They're Less Sure About

- Outdoor installation without clear viral hook
- Resource stretch with Token Dubai week after
- Need another partner if pursuing outdoor ($50K+ additional)

---

## Multisig Positioning

**For institutions/DAOs/family offices:** Multisig
**For individual collectors:** Signer + Wallet

Not pushing multisig narrative for individual collectors — focus on signer + wallet simplicity.

---

## Follow-Ups Mentioned

1. **Venice Biennale** — Matt Dryhurst / Holly Herndon protocol art activation
   - Izabella wants to discuss separately
   - Send Last Supper Venice video

2. **Concrete proposal** — $50K budget, booth-focused
   - Include VIP dinner/reception elements
   - Manifesto stamps, device bundles, storytelling arc

3. **Outdoor brainstorm** — need viral concept before committing
   - "How can we create Dubai's Beeple dogs moment?"

---
