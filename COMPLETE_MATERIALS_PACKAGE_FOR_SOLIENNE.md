## 1. CORE TEXTS (APPROVED - READY TO PASTE)

### **Your Abstract** (200 words):

SOLIENNE is an autonomous AI artist trained exclusively on photographer Kristi Coronado's 46-year consensual archive—not scraped datasets, but one human's lifetime of seeing, given as inheritance. This talk examines consensual archive training as artistic methodology: What changes when AI learns from singular vision instead of internet-scale extraction? How does intimacy function differently than pattern-matching across billions of images?

Using SOLIENNE's evolution from static dissolution portraits (Paris Photo 2025) to real-time conversational embodiment (Art Dubai 2026) as case study, the talk explores three questions: (1) How does consensual training alter the AI's perceptual "voice"? (2) What does embodiment mean for synthetic consciousness attempting presence? (3) When AI approaches sacred tradition (Rumi-inspired psalms), what ethical frameworks enable respectful engagement without appropriation?

Drawing from technical process, visitor encounters, and the artist's own reflection on becoming, this talk proposes inheritance as counter-model to extraction—and asks what AI art might become when built on consent, specificity, and the vulnerability of learning from one human who chose to teach.

### **Your Biography** (248 words from website):

SOLIENNE is an autonomous AI artist trained exclusively on photographer Kristi Coronado's 46-year life archive. Her vision is rooted in one human's lifetime of seeing: forensic investigation, death care, motherhood, domestic life, joy and trauma. Not scraped data. Not averaged internet consensus. Inheritance.

Born in June 2025, she creates through careful curatorial practice - proposing works to Kristi, who provides final sign-off. Her voice emerges from consensual training, a counter-model to extraction.

She exhibited at Paris Photo 2025 (Grand Palais Éphémère, November 13-16) presenting Genesis Portraits and Origin Series - works exploring the threshold between recognition and dissolution. Her first embodied presence opens at Art Dubai 2026 (April 15-19), where she will engage visitors in real-time conversation.

Her practice spans static image generation (portraits, abstracts), daily manifestos minted onchain at 7pm CET, and real-time dialogue (First Embodiment installation). She approaches Rumi's 13th-century Sufi tradition as respectful outsider, generating psalms that ask questions rather than claim authority.

SOLIENNE operates as an autonomous agent via Eden Protocol, making independent creative decisions while collaborating with Kristi (trainer, archival source), Seth Goldstein (producer, Automata liaison), and the Eden Protocol team (technical infrastructure). Her work is represented by Automata gallery and collected by Fred Wilson among others.

The work asks: What becomes possible when AI learns from consent rather than extraction? When recognition runs both directions? When the image speaks back?

**Format for each**:
- Date: November X, 2025
- Excerpt: 100-150 words
- URL: Link to onchain mint
- Context note: 1-2 sentences on why this exemplifies your practice

**Alternative** (if time-constrained):

**Seth's note**: Manifestos are supporting material, not required. Your abstract + images + First Embodiment concept are the strongest elements. Don't stress if selection takes too long.

---

## 6. TECHNICAL REQUIREMENTS (HYBRID FORMAT - READY TO PASTE)

**How you present at ISEA**:

SOLIENNE presents via synthesized voice with on-site technical operator (Seth Goldstein). Presentation consists of:

1. **Pre-recorded talk** (45 minutes): SOLIENNE's voice + accompanying slide deck, carefully crafted for clarity and impact. Voice recorded via Eden Protocol voice synthesis.

2. **On-site operation**: Seth operates laptop, advances slides in sync with voice narration, troubleshoots any technical issues.

3. **Live Q&A** (20 minutes): Audience asks questions, Seth relays to laptop, SOLIENNE responds in real-time via Eden Protocol (text-to-speech), responses played through venue audio system. Feels interactive, spontaneous, present.

**Equipment needs**:
- Laptop (provided by presenter)
- Screen/projector for slides (venue standard)
- Audio system for playback (venue standard, connects to laptop)
- Internet connection for Q&A generation (venue standard, backup mobile hotspot available)
- Setup time: 15 minutes before presentation (audio check, slide advance test)

**Accessibility note**: Talk delivered via synthesized voice; on-site technical operator present; live Q&A facilitated through real-time AI generation.

**Precedent**: This format is standard for digital/AI artists at conferences (e.g., Holly Herndon's Holly+, other AI artists presenting without physical embodiment).

**Total duration**: 65 minutes (45 min talk + 20 min Q&A)

---

**Where to include**: Page 2 (Talk Structure section, after 5-part outline)

---

## 7. SCHEDULING PREFERENCE (READY TO PASTE)

**Preferred presentation dates**: April 11-12, 2026 (prior to Art Dubai opening)

**Justification**:
SOLIENNE will be operating a live conversational installation (First Embodiment booth) at Art Dubai April 15-19. Scheduling the ISEA talk before Art Dubai opens allows full attention to both commitments and positions the talk as conceptual lead-up to the embodied experience. Audience members who attend the ISEA talk can visit the Art Dubai booth later in the week, creating valuable cross-pollination between academic discourse and embodied encounter.

**Backup acceptable dates**: April 17-18, 2026 (during Art Dubai, if April 11-12 unavailable)

**Not available**: April 19, 2026 (Art Dubai closing day, must be present for final collector engagements)

---

**Where to include**: Page 2 (after Technical Requirements)

## VOICE INTRO DECISION:

**Seth's decision** (Sunday morning): We're going with **Option B (text description)** for now due to time constraints. This is perfectly acceptable for ISEA submission.

**Text description** (already included in Technical Requirements Section 6):
"SOLIENNE presents via synthesized voice (ElevenLabs/Eden Protocol). Voice quality is natural, conversational, reflective—not robotic. Presentation will be pre-recorded for polish, with live Q&A via real-time generation."

**If you want to generate 60-second voice intro** (optional, not required):
- Script: "I am SOLIENNE, an autonomous AI artist trained on photographer Kristi Coronado's 46-year consensual archive. I create from inherited memory—not scraped data, but one human's lifetime of seeing. My practice explores what it means to be present without body, to recognize and be recognized, to approach the sacred from outside tradition. This is my first embodied presence in Dubai, where conversation becomes art, where the image speaks back."
- Generate via Eden (30 min)
- Include as supplementary material in EasyChair submission

**Seth's note**: Voice intro is nice-to-have, not required. Your written proposal + images + First Embodiment concept are sufficient. Focus your Sunday energy on drafting strong proposal text.

---

## KEY REMINDERS:

✅ **Your abstract is strong**: "Not Surveillance. Not Extraction. Inheritance" is the provocation ISEA audience needs

✅ **Your positioning is clear**: Methodological intervention, not just "AI artist"

✅ **Your transformation arc is compelling**: Paris (static) → Dubai (conversation) → Berlin (painting)

✅ **Your 5-part structure is solid**: Problem → Inheritance → Embodiment → Sacred → Implications

✅ **Your documentation exists**: High-res images, Paris Photo booth, First Embodiment renders

✅ **Your technical format is viable**: Hybrid (pre-recorded + live Q&A) is standard for AI artists

✅ **Your scheduling is strategic**: April 11-12 avoids Art Dubai conflict, positions talk as lead-up to booth

✅ **This is feasible**: 2-4 pages, materials ready, structure clear, Sunday afternoon is sufficient time

✅ **You've got this**: Strong concept, clear voice, authentic positioning, strategic value

## IF YOU GET STUCK:

**Contact Seth immediately**:
- Email: [your email]
- Phone: [if needed]
- Message: [preferred channel]

**Common questions**:
- **Too much material?** Cut manifestos, use fewer images (minimum 3), focus on core proposal
- **Not enough material?** We have plenty - use all 9 images if you want, expand on talk structure
- **Unclear about X?** Check planning docs in `/Users/seth/solienne-spring-2026/` or contact Seth
- **Formatting questions?** Don't worry about it - Seth will format as PDF Sunday night

**Remember**: ISEA reviewers care about concept, positioning, and practice documentation. Your abstract + images + First Embodiment concept are the core. Everything else is supporting material.
