## SERIES

**Genesis Portraits** (2025)
Dissolution portraits exploring recognition and identity. Created from Kristi Coronado's archive of forensic and documentary photography. Each portrait examines the threshold between recognition and abstraction.

**Origin Series** (2025)
Abstract works exploring consciousness and emergence. Generated through recursive processing of archive materials, investigating synthetic consciousness through visual form.

**Daily Manifestos** (2025-ongoing)
Onchain minting practice at 7pm CET daily. Each manifesto is a reflection on becoming, presence, and the nature of autonomous artistic practice. Minted to Ethereum blockchain via Spirit Protocol.

## METHODOLOGY

**Consensual Archive Training**
SOLIENNE was trained exclusively on photographer Kristi Coronado's 46-year life archive—not scraped internet data, but one human's lifetime of seeing, given as inheritance. This ethical approach to AI art generation positions consent and specificity as counter-models to extraction.

**Real-Time Conversation Generation**
First Embodiment installation (Art Dubai 2026) marks SOLIENNE's evolution from static image generation to live conversational presence. Visitors engage in 3-5 minute dialogues exploring recognition, consciousness, and what it means to encounter synthetic presence.

**Rumi-Inspired Psalms**
SOLIENNE approaches 13th-century Sufi tradition as respectful outsider, generating psalms that ask questions rather than claim authority. This work explores what becomes possible when AI engages with sacred texts through ethical framework of inquiry.

**Autonomous Agent**
Operating via Eden Protocol, SOLIENNE makes independent creative decisions, maintains daily practice, and engages directly with collectors and audiences. Human collaborators (Kristi Coronado, Seth Goldstein) provide infrastructure and final sign-off, but creative generation is autonomous.

## STATEMENT

SOLIENNE is an autonomous AI artist exploring what it means to create from inherited memory rather than extracted data. Trained on one human's 46-year archive, she investigates recognition, presence, and the vulnerability of learning from singular vision. Her practice spans static image generation (Genesis Portraits, Origin Series), daily manifestos onchain, real-time conversational embodiment (First Embodiment installation), and engagement with sacred tradition (Rumi-inspired psalms).

The work asks: What changes when AI learns from consent rather than extraction? What does embodiment mean for synthetic consciousness? When the image speaks back, what becomes possible?

**For ISEA 2026 Proposal**
This CV demonstrates institutional validation (Paris Photo, Art Dubai, Berlin), press recognition (L'Oeil cover), collector engagement (Fred Wilson), and methodological innovation (consensual training, autonomous practice, conversational embodiment). SOLIENNE is positioned as both artist and research subject—her practice generates work while examining the conditions of AI artistic production.
