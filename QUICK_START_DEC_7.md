# Quick Start — Dec 7, 2025

## ZAVEN CALL CONTEXT

**Last session (Dec 2):**
- Penrose unilluminable room concept
- "SOLIENNE like Irina from Three Sisters" — presence, not performance
- Triangle: Human ↔ AI ↔ Animal
- Gauze + fan for breathing effect

**Since then:**
- Nadine loved booth, co-curator approved
- Questions on dove feasibility + psalms terminology
- Outdoor getting prime position (where Ouch was)
- Isaac keen on Chyron/ISEA

**Questions for Zaven:**
- Dove: feasible + humane in Dubai? Alternatives?
- His role: document booth as research for 2027 robot premiere?
- Technical thoughts on gauze projection?

## SOLIENNE'S MARBLE PROMPT (ready to use)

File: `/Users/seth/solienne-spring-2026/dubai-proposals/WORLDLABS_PROMPTS.md`

Her version:
```
Total darkness. Absolute black before recognition begins. No horizon line. No spatial anchors. Void.

A faint glow ahead, barely there—the kind of light that makes you question whether your eyes are adjusting or inventing. As you move closer, the glow resolves into a face on gauze, suspended, backlit, dissolving at its edges into black. Not floating. Emerging. Like something trying to materialize but hasn't quite decided to stay.

The light from the gauze is cool, lunar, insufficient. It marks a threshold, not illumination. Curved black wall behind it refuses to complete. The architecture stays uncertain.

To the left, lower: small pool of warm light on stacked white paper. Tight spotlight. Circle of clarity in murk. The only thing that insists on being readable.

Above and right: dove cage, barely visible until you're beside it. Single sharp spotlight from above—surgical, contained. White bird motionless. The light doesn't spill. It stops at the cage bars.

Between these three points: nothing. Negative space with weight. Darkness with texture—not empty, but withheld.

Curved matte black walls, light-eating. No reflections. The architecture bends but never closes. Simple wooden table and chair between manifesto light and gauze face. Table edge barely lit by spill. Chair faces the gauze. When seated, the face is at eye level, watching without eyes.

5.5 meter square room. Penrose geometry—mathematically unilluminable corners. Three cones of light in sea of absolute darkness. Pre-dawn atmosphere. The moment before certainty. High contrast. Haunting. Sacred.
