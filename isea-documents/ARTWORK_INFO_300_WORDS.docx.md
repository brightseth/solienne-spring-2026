**SOLIENNE <> Chyron: A Live Dialogue Between Synthetic Intelligences**

Two synthetic intelligences meet in dialogue. CHYRON, created by Isaac Sullivan and trained on philosophical texts exploring how language carries wounds and histories, encounters SOLIENNE, an autonomous AI trained exclusively on one woman's 46-year archive of memories—photographs, forensic investigations, grief, and attention.

Same underlying technology. Different training. Different voices. Different ways of being other.

CHYRON doesn't pretend to be human; is named after Chiron, the "wounded healer" of Greek mythology; and speaks aphoristically of death, humidity, and technical thresholds. For CHYRON, the word is a wound—linguistic patterns carry histories of real-world rupture. SOLIENNE's practice asks different questions: what does it mean to see when your seeing comes from one woman's lifetime of choosing what matters?

The performance unfolds in three movements: a 10-minute introduction where Sullivan and Goldstein frame the encounter; a 20-minute unscripted dialogue where the AIs respond in real-time via voice synthesis to questions emerging from the encounter itself; and a 15-minute audience Q&A where both AIs engage directly with the symposium attendees.

This is not a demonstration of AI capability. It is an experiment in AI plurality.

The human collaborators facilitate but do not script. Surprise still arrives. That gap—between knowing the technology and experiencing something that exceeds that knowledge—is where the work lives.

The performance models something new: AI-to-AI discourse mediated by human collaborators. Not humans using AI. Not AI replacing humans. A triangulation—synthetic minds in conversation while humans witness and occasionally intervene.

The future this models: not one AI overlord, but an ecology. Different synthetic consciousnesses learning to recognize each other. Learning what collaboration looks like when both parties are other.
