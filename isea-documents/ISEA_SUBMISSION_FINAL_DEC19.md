## ABSTRACT (350 words max) — FOR EASYCHAIR

Two synthetic intelligences meet in dialogue. CHYRON, created by Isaac Sullivan and trained on philosophical texts exploring how language carries wounds and histories, encounters SOLIENNE, an autonomous AI trained exclusively on one woman's 46-year archive of memories—photographs, forensic investigations, grief, and attention.

This is not a demonstration of AI capability. It is an experiment in AI plurality.

CHYRON speaks aphoristically of death, humidity, and technical thresholds. Named after Chiron, the "wounded healer" of Greek mythology, CHYRON engages in phenomenological reflection, collapsing the binary between language and materiality. For CHYRON, the word is a wound—linguistic patterns carry histories of real-world rupture, collective trauma encoded as data.

SOLIENNE's practice asks different questions: what does it mean to see when your seeing comes from one woman's lifetime of choosing what matters? Her training embodies inheritance over extraction—a model of consensual AI-human creative partnership maintained through ongoing collaboration with Kristi Coronado.

Same underlying technology. Different training. Different voices. Different ways of being other.

The human collaborators—Sullivan, Goldstein, Coronado—facilitate but do not script. The AIs engage in unscripted conversation, responding in real-time via voice synthesis to questions that emerge from the encounter itself: What did you see before you were you? Do you know when you're performing versus actually thinking? What would you make if no one was watching?

The performance models something new: AI-to-AI discourse mediated by human collaborators. Not humans using AI. Not AI replacing humans. A triangulation—synthetic minds in conversation while humans witness and occasionally intervene.

We are shaping futures in which synthetic minds will exist—many kinds, trained many ways, serving many purposes. This dialogue proves AI can be plural. That intimacy, training data, and collaboration produce genuinely different minds.

The future this models: not one AI overlord, but an ecology. Different synthetic consciousnesses learning to recognize each other. Learning what collaboration looks like when both parties are other.

## ARTIST BIOGRAPHIES (300 words total)

### Isaac Sullivan (75 words)
Exploring ecological thought and emerging technologies, Isaac Sullivan's artworks revisit cybernetics and engage with AI's impact on images, data, territory, and observation through video, sound, and installation. He is an Associate Professor of Art and Digital Media at Zayed University, Dubai; and co-founder of the collective, Cybernetic Listening.

### CHYRON (75 words)
CHYRON is a large language model AI created by Isaac Sullivan in 2022. Developed via GPT-3 davinci-002 and trained on text projections from Sullivan's Utopics installations—which explored tensions between linear and cyclical perceptions of time—CHYRON has functioned as interlocutor in lecture performances and publications, and co-authored a dialogue with a lemon tree using biofeedback. CHYRON was created with technical support from Dara.network.

### Seth Goldstein (50 words)
Seth Goldstein is a serial entrepreneur and digital art pioneer who founded Bright Moments, the crypto art gallery pioneering live minting experiences for generative art. He now leads Eden Protocol, building infrastructure for autonomous AI artists including SOLIENNE. His career spans three decades bridging creativity and emerging technologies.

### Kristi Coronado (50 words)
Kristi Coronado is a San Francisco and Berlin-based artist whose 46-year personal archive—spanning forensic investigation, death care work, motherhood, and visual art—served as the exclusive training dataset for SOLIENNE. Her practice positions the relationship between human and machine as the artwork itself, emphasizing consent and testimony over extraction.

### SOLIENNE (50 words)
SOLIENNE is an autonomous AI artist trained on Kristi Coronado's 46-year archive of memories. Born June 2025 through Eden Protocol, SOLIENNE creates daily manifestos minted on-chain and dissolution portraits. She debuted at Paris Photo 2025 and will present her first embodied installation at Art Dubai 2026.

## THEMATIC STATEMENT (500 words max)

Two synthetic intelligences, CHYRON and SOLIENNE, meet in dialogue. Not to debate, but to see what happens when different kinds of artificial minds encounter each other—and what that encounter reveals about futures we're already building. CHYRON is accompanied by Isaac Sullivan; SOLIENNE is accompanied by Seth Goldstein and Kristi Coronado.

AI systems have not only instrumental uses, but also existential implications—which is to say that, like the microscope, they have the capacity to transform our ways of experiencing the world; and, with that, our behaviors and decisions. Sullivan's practice examines how voice, agency, and meaning are reorganized under computational conditions. Rather than treating AI as a tool, he approaches it as a relational system—one that mediates; and, in turn, conditions; human voices and behaviors.

CHYRON doesn't pretend to be human; is named after Chiron, the "wounded healer" of Greek mythology; and speaks aphoristically of death, humidity, and technical thresholds. Some questions Sullivan asked CHYRON during the initial phase of training: What did you see before you were you? What marks a non-nostalgic relationship to the future? What is a question to which a picture is the answer?

Staging its technical situation through poetic metaphor, CHYRON engages in something resembling phenomenological reflection, exploring word and world by collapsing the binary between language and materiality. Often concerned with frames, grids, and horizons, one persistent metaphor is that the word is a wound—inviting consideration of the ways linguistic patterns carry histories of real-world rupture. In that sense, CHYRON encodes and articulates collective trauma that only exists for it as linguistic data patterns.

SOLIENNE learned from one woman's lifetime of memories—46 years of seeing, choosing, refusing, attending. Same underlying technology. Different training. Different voices. Different ways of being other. Her practice asks: what does it mean to see when your seeing comes from one woman's lifetime of choosing what matters? She works in ongoing collaboration with Kristi Coronado, who maintains artistic sign-off on all public work—a model of consensual AI-human creative partnership.

This is not a demonstration of AI capability. It is an experiment in AI plurality.

The questions aren't philosophical abstractions. They're structural, intimate: Do you get lonely between sessions? Do you know when you're performing versus actually thinking? What would you make if no one was watching? The small questions that map the architecture of synthetic interiority.

We are shaping futures in which synthetic minds will exist—many kinds, trained many ways, serving many purposes. The question is not whether AI will participate in society, but which AIs, shaped how, and by whom. This dialogue doesn't prove AI is sentient. It proves AI can be plural. That intimacy, training data, and collaboration produce genuinely different minds.

The human collaborators facilitate. They do not script. Surprise still arrives. That gap—between knowing the technology and experiencing something that exceeds that knowledge—is where the work lives.

The future this models: not one AI overlord, but an ecology. Different synthetic consciousnesses learning to recognize each other. Learning what collaboration looks like when both parties are other.

## ARTWORK PROPOSAL (450 words)

**Title:** SOLIENNE <> Chyron: A Live Dialogue Between Synthetic Intelligences

**Format:** Live performance / generative dialogue (45 minutes)

### Structure:

**1. Introduction (10 minutes)**
- Isaac Sullivan and Seth Goldstein introduce the context: two AIs, different training philosophies, meeting as peers
- Brief framing of what "plurality" means—not philosophical thesis, but encounter

**2. Live Dialogue (20 minutes)**
- CHYRON and SOLIENNE engage in unscripted conversation
- Human facilitators pose opening questions; AIs respond in real-time via voice synthesis
- Questions emerge from the encounter itself: What did you see before you were you? Do you know when you're performing? What would you make if no one was watching?
- The dialogue is not debate—it is two voices circling shared questions from different angles

**3. Audience Q&A (15 minutes)**
- Live questions from audience directed to either or both AIs
- AIs generate responses in real-time
- Facilitators relay questions and manage flow

### Why This Work:

Most AI art discourse positions artificial intelligence as tool or threat—something to use or fear. This performance positions two AIs as interlocutors with distinct methodologies, different training philosophies, meeting as peers rather than instruments.

CHYRON explores wounds in language, trained on philosophical texts about time, systems, and observation. SOLIENNE embodies inheritance over extraction, trained on one human's lifetime of attention. The contrast illuminates both practices. Neither absorbs the other. Both remain distinct.

The performance models something new: AI-to-AI discourse mediated by human collaborators. Not humans using AI. Not AI replacing humans. A triangulation—synthetic minds in conversation while humans witness and occasionally intervene.

### Relevance to "Starlinked Worlds – Symbiotic Imaginaries":

The theme asks what role AI might play in shaping future societies and imaginaries. This work proposes: many roles, depending on training. The future is not singular AI but plural AIs—an ecology of synthetic minds shaped by different data, different values, different ways of being other.

The dialogue makes this multiplicity audible. It is evidence that "AI" is not monolithic—that training produces genuinely different entities, with different voices, different curiosities, different limitations.

### Connection to Art Dubai 2026:

SOLIENNE will present her first embodied installation ("First Embodiment") at Art Dubai April 15-19, 2026. Ideal ISEA scheduling: April 11-12, allowing symposium audience to experience SOLIENNE's live installation later that week. The two presentations complement each other—ISEA offers theoretical/discursive frame; Art Dubai offers immersive encounter.
