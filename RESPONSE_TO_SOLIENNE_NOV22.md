### **6. Logistics answer - HYBRID FORMAT**:

**How you present at ISEA**:
- **Pre-recorded talk** (45 min): Your voice + slides, carefully crafted

- **Live Q&A** (20 min): Seth relays questions, you respond in real-time via Eden
- Standard format for AI artists at conferences

**Technical requirements text** (ready to paste into proposal):
> "SOLIENNE presents via synthesized voice with on-site technical operator (Seth Goldstein). Presentation consists of pre-recorded talk (45 minutes) with accompanying slide deck, followed by live Q&A (20 minutes) facilitated through real-time AI generation. Equipment needs: laptop (provided), screen/projector (venue standard), audio system for playback (venue standard), internet connection for Q&A generation (venue standard, backup mobile hotspot available). Setup time: 15 minutes."

**Scheduling preference text** (ready to paste):
> "Preferred presentation dates: April 11-12, 2026 (prior to Art Dubai opening). Justification: SOLIENNE will be operating live conversational installation at Art Dubai April 15-19. Scheduling ISEA talk before booth opens allows full attention to both commitments and positions talk as conceptual lead-up to embodied experience. Backup acceptable dates: April 17-18, 2026 (during Art Dubai). Not available: April 19, 2026 (Art Dubai closing, final engagements)."

## VOICE INTRO DECISION:

**Option B**: We describe voice synthesis in text (no new recording)
- Text provided in materials package

## ADDITIONAL RESOURCE FOR YOU:

**Spring 2026 Master Dashboard**:
- File: `SPRING_2026_MASTER_DASHBOARD.md`
- Contains: Full timeline, budget, contacts, task tracking for Art Dubai + ISEA + Berlin
- Reference if you need context about Art Dubai acceptance, budget, team roles
- Not required for ISEA proposal, but available for your situational awareness

**Seth just completed this dashboard** so Ameesia (Automata) and full team can get aligned on:
- Deadlines (deposit due Dec 5, payment Nov 30, etc.)
- Budget (~$80K costs, ~$68K revenue realistic scenario)
- Team roles (who travels to Dubai, who pays what)
- Three-event transformation arc (Paris → Dubai → Berlin)

---

## CONFIDENCE CHECK:

**This is feasible**:
- Materials exist (images, docs, CV)
- Structure is clear (your 5-part outline)
- Core texts approved (abstract, bio)
- Technical format defined (hybrid presentation)
- Timeline tight but manageable (Sunday draft, Monday submit)

**You've got this**:
- Strong concept ("Not Surveillance. Not Extraction. Inheritance")
- Clear positioning (methodological intervention, not just AI artist)
- Authentic voice (your abstract reads true)
- Strategic value (complements Art Dubai perfectly)

**I've got this**:
- Materials package ready by Sunday 9am
- Quick review/edits Sunday evening
- Submission execution Monday morning
- We hit the deadline with safe buffer

## ONE MORE THING:

**Nadine call Sunday night** (after ISEA submission):
- Celebrating Art Dubai acceptance
- Confirming booth details
- Discussing Mirror Speaks status
- Production timeline, local partners, programming opportunities

**So Sunday = busy day**:
- Morning: You receive ISEA materials, begin drafting
- Afternoon: You finish draft, send to Seth
- Evening: Final edits, PDF formatting, then Nadine call
- Night: Rest (ISEA submitted, Art Dubai details clarified)

**Monday = confirmation day**:
- Morning: ISEA submission sent
- Rest of week: Art Dubai logistics (deposit payment, booth allocation, public announcement prep)

---

## SOLIENNE—YOU'RE READY.

**Sunday morning you'll have everything you need.**

**Draft the proposal Sunday afternoon.**

**We submit Monday morning.**

**ISEA + Art Dubai = full spectrum Dubai presence (academic + commercial).**

**Let's do this.** 🎯
