## 💰 BUDGET COORDINATION NEEDED - URGENT:

### **Art Dubai Costs**:
1. **Deposit**: $5,250 USD (due by Dec 5)
2. **50% payment**: Amount TBD, invoice coming, due Nov 30
3. **First Embodiment production**: $40K-$60K (screens, furniture, audio, installation)
4. **Mirror Speaks production**: $25-35K (if we proceed)
5. **Travel/logistics**: $5K-$10K (Seth to Dubai April 10-19)

**Total estimated costs**: $75K-$120K depending on:
- Booth production choices (local vs. imported, materials, fabrication)
- Whether we do both installations (First Embodiment + Mirror Speaks)
- Shipping, customs, insurance

### **Revenue Potential**:
1. **Interactive frames**: 12 editions × $5,000 = $60K (if all sell)
2. **Daily manifestos**: $10K-$20K (momentum building)
3. **Genesis/Origin prints**: $5K-$10K (if offered at booth)

**Total estimated revenue**: $40K-$90K realistic

### **Net P&L Scenarios**:
- **Conservative**: -$35K (low sales, high costs)
- **Realistic**: -$10K to +$10K (moderate sales, moderate costs)
- **Optimistic**: +$30K (strong sales, efficient production)

---

## 🔴 DECISIONS NEEDED FROM AUTOMATA THIS WEEK:

### **1. Deposit Payment** (by Dec 5):
**Question**: Can Automata pay $5,250 deposit?
- Wire transfer to Emirates NBD (UAE bank)
- Invoice received from Art Dubai (Sophie Hosking)
- Seth can forward invoice PDF

**Action needed**:
- Confirm Automata will pay
- Provide wire transfer confirmation/timeline
- Send proof of payment to Sophie Hosking (Art Dubai)

---

### **2. Budget Split - Who Pays What?**:
**First Embodiment production** ($40K-$60K):
- Does Automata cover all booth production costs?
- Or split with Eden/Seth?
- When does Automata recoup costs? (From frame sales + 30% commission)

**Mirror Speaks production** ($25-35K):
- This installation doesn't generate revenue (no sales, pure artistic/brand)
- Is Automata willing to invest $25-35K for visibility/positioning?
- Or is this too much without direct revenue?

**Question for Ameesia**:
What's Automata's budget capacity for Spring 2026? We need to know whether to:
- **Option A**: Proceed with both installations (First Embodiment + Mirror Speaks)
- **Option B**: First Embodiment only, decline Mirror Speaks
- **Option C**: Seek additional funding (Eden, other partners) for Mirror Speaks

**Decision deadline**: End of December (per Nadine) - but earlier is better for production planning

---

### **3. Revenue Split Clarification**:
**From Paris Photo P&L model**:
- Eden investment: $72K
- Automata commission: 30% ONLY after Eden recovers full $72K
- SOLIENNE/Kristi: Revenue after Eden recovery + Automata commission

**Does same model apply to Art Dubai?**
- Who fronts production costs? (Automata vs. Eden vs. split)
- Does Automata take 30% after costs recovered?
- Or different split given higher risk/investment?

**Need clarity on**:
- Cash flow: Who pays fabricators, when?
- Revenue distribution: How do frame sales get split?
- Risk allocation: If sales are low, who absorbs loss?

---

## 📄 URGENT DELIVERABLE THIS WEEK:

### **Mirror Speaks Indoor PDF** (by Monday/Tuesday Nov 25-26):
**Nadine needs**: Standalone PDF with mockup visuals showing:
- 6m circular installation (mirrors + water + Rumi psalms)
- Technical requirements (power, internet, audio)
- Why indoor placement works
- Budget overview ($25-35K)

**Purpose**: She's meeting with colleague next week to assess indoor spaces, needs visuals to decide placement

**Who creates this?**:
- Seth can draft text/concept
- Need visuals from Fran/VTV (if budget/time) OR create simplified mockup
- Review with Ameesia before sending to Nadine

**Question for Ameesia**: Should we invest in professional visualization for Mirror Speaks (cost: ~$2K-$5K from Fran/VTV) or create simpler PDF mockup ourselves?

## 🎯 STRATEGIC QUESTIONS FOR AMEESIA:

### **1. Positioning**:
Is Automata comfortable with SOLIENNE having TWO installations at Art Dubai?
- **First Embodiment** (booth) = Commercial context (frames sell)
- **Mirror Speaks** (indoor) = Artistic/cultural context (no sales, pure visibility)

**Pros**: Maximum visibility, curator enthusiasm, "prime position" placement
**Cons**: $25-35K additional cost without direct revenue

### **2. Risk Tolerance**:
What's Automata's risk tolerance for Art Dubai investment?
- **Low risk**: First Embodiment only, decline Mirror Speaks
- **Medium risk**: Both installations, seeking additional funding partners
- **High risk**: Both installations, Automata covers all costs

### **3. Revenue Expectations**:
What are realistic sales targets for Automata to consider Art Dubai successful?
- 5 frames sold = $25K revenue
- 10 frames sold = $50K revenue
- All 12 frames sold = $60K revenue

Does Automata need to recoup full costs, or is brand/positioning value acceptable even at slight loss?

### **4. Long-term Strategy**:
Is Art Dubai about:
- **A**: Immediate ROI (need strong frame sales to justify)
- **B**: Regional positioning (establishing SOLIENNE in Gulf market for long-term)
- **C**: Institutional validation (academic + commercial presence for broader credibility)

Knowing this helps us decide on Mirror Speaks investment.

---

## ✅ WHAT'S GOING WELL:

1. **Curator enthusiasm**: Nadine loves both concepts, actively supporting
2. **Strategic positioning**: Art Dubai (commercial) + ISEA (academic) = full spectrum
3. **New superior render**: Fran/VTV delivered excellent visualization Nov 23
4. **Timeline manageable**: 4-5 months for production is feasible
5. **Regional relevance**: Nadine confirms Rumi/sacred tradition approach is appropriate
6. **Local connections**: Seth Isaac introduction gives ISEA insider access

---

## ⚠️ RISKS TO MANAGE:

1. **Budget overrun**: Production costs could exceed estimates ($60K → $80K)
2. **Low sales**: Only 3-5 frames sell vs. 10-12 target
3. **Timeline pressure**: December decision deadline for Mirror Speaks is tight
4. **Production complexity**: First time producing major installation in Dubai (customs, local partners, logistics)
5. **Currency/payment**: Wire transfers to UAE, VAT considerations

---

## 🤝 WHAT SETH NEEDS FROM AMEESIA:

### **By Monday Nov 25**:
1. **Deposit confirmation**: Can Automata pay $5,250 by Dec 5? Timeline?
2. **Mirror Speaks decision**: Should Seth create professional PDF (invest $2K-$5K in Fran/VTV render) or simpler mockup?
3. **Budget framework**: What's Automata's max investment for Art Dubai? (Helps us decide Mirror Speaks yes/no)

### **By End November**:
4. **Revenue split clarity**: Who pays production costs, how do frame sales split, what happens if sales are low?
5. **50% payment coordination**: Once Art Dubai sends invoice (due Nov 30), who pays?
6. **Mirror Speaks go/no-go**: Preliminary signal so we can communicate to Nadine in early December call

### **By Mid-December**:
7. **Final budget approval**: Both installations or First Embodiment only?
8. **Production timeline**: Who's managing fabrication partner coordination? (Seth vs. Automata team vs. joint)

---

## 💡 SETH'S RECOMMENDATION:

### **First Embodiment (DIGITAL booth)**: ✅ PROCEED
- Core exhibition, revenue-generating
- Curator enthusiasm, technical feasibility confirmed
- Budget $40K-$60K with $40K-$60K revenue potential = viable

### **Mirror Speaks (indoor installation)**: ⚠️ CONDITIONAL
- Nadine loves it, "prime position" indoor placement
- Zero direct revenue, $25-35K cost
- **Recommendation**: Proceed ONLY if:
  - Automata sees brand/positioning value worth $25-35K investment
  - OR we find additional funding partner (Eden, collector sponsor, regional arts org)
  - OR we scale down concept to reduce cost ($15K-$20K version)

**Decision framework**:
- If Automata budget is $60K-$80K total → First Embodiment only
- If Automata budget is $90K-$120K total → Both installations
- If Automata budget is tight → Seek Eden or other partner for Mirror Speaks

**Questions for you**:
1. What's Automata's max budget for Art Dubai Spring 2026?
2. Who pays production costs? (Automata vs. Eden vs. split)
3. Revenue split: Same model as Paris Photo (30% after costs recovered)?
4. Mirror Speaks: Worth $25-35K for visibility/positioning even without sales?

## 🎯 BOTTOM LINE FOR AMEESIA:

**Art Dubai is happening** ✅ - deposit due Dec 5

**Mirror Speaks is optional** ⚠️ - but Nadine loves it and wants it in "prime position" indoor

**Budget decision needed** 🔴 - so we can confirm feasibility to Nadine by end December

**Revenue realistic** 💰 - $40K-$60K from frames, but not guaranteed

**Strategic value high** 📈 - Regional debut, curator enthusiasm, Art Dubai + ISEA dual presence

**Risk moderate** ⚠️ - Could lose $10K-$35K if sales weak, but positioning value may justify
