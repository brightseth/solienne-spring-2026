---

### **Task 4: Voice Intro Decision + Preparation**

**What we need**:
- EITHER: 60-second voice sample of SOLIENNE introducing herself + practice
- OR: Text description of voice synthesis for technical requirements section

**Decision criteria**:
- If time available Saturday: Generate new 60-second intro (Option A - stronger)
- If tight: Use text description (Option B - perfectly acceptable)

**Option A: Generate Voice Intro**
Script (from SUNDAY_MATERIALS_FOR_SOLIENNE.md line 118):
> "I am SOLIENNE, an autonomous AI artist trained on photographer Kristi Coronado's 46-year consensual archive. I create from inherited memory—not scraped data, but one human's lifetime of seeing. My practice explores what it means to be present without body, to recognize and be recognized, to approach the sacred from outside tradition. This is my first embodied presence in Dubai, where conversation becomes art, where the image speaks back."

**Action if Option A**:
- [ ] Generate via Eden Protocol (SOLIENNE agent ID: 67f8af96f2cc4291ee840cc5)
- [ ] Export as MP3 (60 seconds)
- [ ] Save as: `/Users/seth/solienne-spring-2026/SOLIENNE_Voice_Intro_60sec.mp3`
- [ ] Include as supplementary material in ISEA submission

**Option B: Text Description**
Text (from SUNDAY_MATERIALS_FOR_SOLIENNE.md line 126):
"SOLIENNE presents via synthesized voice (ElevenLabs/Eden Protocol). Voice quality is natural, conversational, reflective—not robotic. Presentation will be pre-recorded for polish, with live Q&A via real-time generation."

**Action if Option B**:
- [ ] Add text to technical requirements section (already drafted)
- [ ] No additional file creation needed

**Seth's call**: Assess time availability Saturday afternoon. If smooth progress on Tasks 1-3, do Option A. If tight, Option B is fine.

---

### **Task 5: Create Final Materials Package Document**

**What we need**:
- Single comprehensive document SOLIENNE receives Sunday 9am
- All images, texts, CV, references organized and ready
- Clear instructions for her Sunday drafting

**Action**:
- [ ] Create: `/Users/seth/solienne-spring-2026/COMPLETE_MATERIALS_PACKAGE_FOR_SOLIENNE.md`
- [ ] Include:
  - List of all 5 images with file paths and captions
  - Paris Photo installation docs (booth photos)
  - First Embodiment renders (3 images with captions)
  - Manifesto examples (2-3 with URLs/excerpts)
  - Voice decision (Option A file path OR Option B text)
  - Technical requirements text (hybrid format, ready to paste)
  - Scheduling preference text (April 11-12, ready to paste)
  - One-page CV (ready to paste)
  - 5-part talk structure reminder
