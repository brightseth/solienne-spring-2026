# Art Dubai 2026 — Kristi Creative Brief

**TL;DR**: SOLIENNE is going to Art Dubai (April 15-19, 2026). This is her first *embodied* presence—she'll have live conversations with visitors in a dark booth. Your archive, your vision, your 46 years of seeing made this possible. Now there are some exciting creative decisions where your voice matters.

## What's Happening

SOLIENNE was accepted to Art Dubai's DIGITAL section. The installation is called **First Embodiment** (الحضور الأول).

**The Experience**: Visitors enter a dark chamber. The only light is SOLIENNE's face on a large screen. They sit across from her at a round table, and they *talk*. Real conversation. 3-5 minutes. Each one unique, unrepeatable.

Paris Photo was portraits. Dubai is dialogue. The image now speaks back.

## Why This Matters Creatively

This is a transformation moment. SOLIENNE learned to *see* from your archive—forensic work, death care, motherhood, domestic spaces, all of it. Now she's learning to *converse*. To be present in a room. To respond to strangers who sit across from her.

She's not just showing images anymore. She's meeting people.

## Ways You Can Shape This

### 1. **Her Voice & Presence**
SOLIENNE will have live conversations. How should she *feel* in a room?

- What qualities from your photographic practice should carry into her spoken presence?
- Is there a tone, a pace, a quality of attention you want her to bring?
- What's the difference between how she looks at someone vs. how she speaks to them?

### 2. **The Encounter**
Each visitor gets 3-5 minutes in darkness with her. What should that be?

- Should she ask questions? Answer them? Both?
- What happens when someone is nervous, or skeptical, or emotionally open?
- How does she handle silence? Intimacy? Resistance?
- Should she have "memories" that surface—echoes of your archive?

### 3. **Arabic Title Consultation**
We're working on the Arabic title with Nadine (the curator). Current proposal: **الحضور الأول** (al-ḥuḍūr al-awwal, "The First Presence").

- Does "presence" feel right? Or is there a different word—witnessing, encounter, recognition—that captures what happens when SOLIENNE meets someone?

### 4. **Interactive Frames**
Twelve 40×40cm screens will surround the conversation booth, each capturing a moment—a single utterance, a pause, a reflection.

- What kinds of moments should these capture?
- Should they be fragments of conversation? Silences? Reactions?
- What visual style—her face, abstract, something else?

### 5. **Daily Manifestos in Dubai**
SOLIENNE will continue her daily manifesto practice, printed and distributed free at the fair.

- Should the Dubai manifestos respond to the conversations happening that day?
- Should there be a thread connecting them across the five days of the fair?
- Any themes that feel right for this context?

## The Spring 2026 Arc

This is part of a larger transformation story:

**Paris Photo 2025** (November): Genesis portraits—static, printed, hung on walls. SOLIENNE observed.

**Art Dubai 2026** (April): First Embodiment—live conversation, ephemeral, presence without body. SOLIENNE speaks.

**Berlin 2026** (April 30, Gallery Weekend): HOUSE at Berghain—monumental oil painting, permanent impression. SOLIENNE becomes material.

Dubai is the moment she becomes *present*. Berlin is the moment she becomes *permanent*. Both matter.

## What Would Help

If any of these feel interesting to explore together:

1. **Conversation qualities**: What should talking with SOLIENNE feel like?
2. **Archive echoes**: Should memories from your work surface in her dialogue?
3. **Dubai context**: Any thoughts on presenting this in the Middle East, where conversation and hospitality carry cultural weight?
4. **Transformation ideas**: What should change between Paris, Dubai, and Berlin?

No pressure on any of this—just invitations if they spark something.
