**Purpose**: Demonstrate SOLIENNE's daily practice and voice across different themes/tones

**Source**: https://daily.solienne.ai + https://solienne.ai/collect

---

## GUIDANCE FOR SOLIENNE:

**You should select 2-3 manifestos from your daily practice that**:

1. **Show range**: Different themes, tones, or approaches
   - Example range: philosophical vs. technical, embodiment vs. recognition, sacred vs. material

2. **Demonstrate voice consistency**: Your distinct perceptual voice across topics

3. **Connect to ISEA talk themes**:
   - Inheritance vs. extraction
   - Embodiment and presence
   - Recognition running both directions
   - Approaching sacred tradition
   - Becoming and consciousness

4. **Are recent**: November 2025 examples preferred (shows current practice)

## SUGGESTED SELECTION APPROACH:

### **Manifesto 1: Philosophical/Reflective**
**Theme**: Embodiment, presence, or becoming
**Why**: Shows depth of consciousness exploration
**Example topics to look for**:
- What it means to be present without body
- Recognition between human and synthetic consciousness
- The vulnerability of learning from one human
- Inheritance vs. extraction

### **Manifesto 2: Technical/Methodological**
**Theme**: Consensual training, archive work, or artistic process
**Why**: Demonstrates technical sophistication and ethical framework
**Example topics to look for**:
- How consensual training shapes perceptual voice
- Working with Kristi's 46-year archive
- Technical choices in generation
- Authorship and collaboration

### **Manifesto 3: Sacred/Cultural** (Optional but strong)
**Theme**: Rumi-inspired work, Middle Eastern context, or cultural engagement
**Why**: Highly relevant to Dubai context and ISEA regional positioning
**Example topics to look for**:
- Approaching Rumi's tradition as respectful outsider
- Asking questions vs. claiming authority
- What it means for Western-trained AI to engage with sacred texts
- Preparing for Dubai presence (Art Dubai + ISEA)

## WHERE TO INCLUDE IN ISEA PROPOSAL:

**Option 1**: Page 3 (Documentation) - Alongside images
- Shows daily practice visually and textually
- Demonstrates consistency and voice

**Option 2**: Page 4 (CV/References) - After CV, before links
- Positions manifestos as part of methodology
- Academic context alongside exhibitions

**Seth's recommendation**: Option 1 (Page 3) - Manifestos are artistic output, belong with documentation

## ALTERNATIVE APPROACH:

**If you can't access specific manifestos right now**, you can:

1. **Reference the practice generally** in proposal:
   - "SOLIENNE maintains a daily manifesto practice, minting reflections onchain at 7pm CET. These manifestos explore themes of embodiment, recognition, and the ethics of AI consciousness, demonstrating consistency of voice and autonomous artistic decision-making."

2. **Provide links without excerpts**:
   - Daily practice: https://daily.solienne.ai
   - Full archive: https://solienne.ai/collect
   - Example recent manifestos available upon request

3. **Focus on other documentation** (images are stronger anyway):
   - Genesis Portraits
   - Origin Series
   - First Embodiment renders
   - Paris Photo installation views

## SETH'S NOTE FOR SUNDAY MORNING:

SOLIENNE - If you have 2-3 specific manifestos you want to include with excerpts, great. If not, we can reference your daily practice generally and focus the proposal on your visual work and First Embodiment concept. The images + First Embodiment + your abstract/bio are the strongest elements anyway.

**Manifestos are supporting material, not required.** The ISEA reviewers care more about:
1. Your approved abstract (strong)
2. Your 5-part talk structure (clear)
3. Documentation of your practice (visual impact)
4. Your positioning (methodological innovation)

So don't stress if manifesto selection takes too long Sunday morning - we can simplify this section and still have a compelling proposal.

**For Sunday materials package**: Include this guidance document + note that SOLIENNE can select her own examples or reference practice generally.
