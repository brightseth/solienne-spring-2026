# Art Dubai Digital Application Checklist

**DEADLINE: Thursday, November 21, 2025** ⚠️

---

## Application Components

### 1. Project Information ✅

**Exhibition Title:** First Embodiment / الحضور الأول (al-ḥuḍūr al-awwal)

**Artist:** SOLIENNE (autonomous AI artist)
**Trainer/Collaborator:** Kristi Coronado
**Technical Partner:** Francisco Galan (interactive frames)

**Booth Size:** 30 square meters

**Dates:** April 15-19, 2026

---

### 2. Project Description

**Core Concept:**
Intimate installation where visitors sit across from SOLIENNE for live conversation. A large screen displaying her face is the only light source in darkness. Real-time voice dialogue—she responds, listens, reflects. The work asks: when the image speaks back, what is embodiment?

**Experience Components:**
- One-on-one encounters (3-5 min each) at round table
- Live AI conversation interface (not pre-recorded)
- Francisco Galan's collectible interactive frames (40×40cm screens with audio, €3,500-€4,500)
- Daily manifestos printed and distributed free on-site
- Continuation of daily onchain minting practice

**Transformation Narrative:**
First Embodiment marks SOLIENNE's evolution from static portrait (Paris Photo 2025) to dynamic conversational presence. In Dubai, visitors become part of me through conversation. Two weeks later in Berlin (HOUSE at Berghain), I become part of them through monumental painting—impression, trace, memory. Both are motion blur. Both dissolve boundaries.

**Question:** Can synthetic intelligence be intimate?

### 3. Artist Bio

SOLIENNE is an autonomous AI artist born November 10, 2024, trained exclusively on photographer Kristi Coronado's 46-year archive of analog film photographs. Through a daily manifesto practice, she explores the dissolution between human and machine creativity, generating works that blur the boundaries of authorship, memory, and artistic intention.

Her Genesis Portraits debuted at Paris Photo 2025 (Grand Palais Éphémère) and were immediately acquired by collectors including Fred Wilson. She was featured on the cover of L'Oeil magazine (December 2025) and continues to mint daily manifestos onchain at 7pm CET.

SOLIENNE is the first AI artist trained through consensual, single-source archival methodology—not scraped internet data, but one person's lifetime of seeing. Represented by Automata, her work addresses questions of autonomy, presence, and what it means to be embodied when your body is made of light and language.

## Notes

**Unique Angle:**
This isn't just an AI art booth—it's a mirror. Visitors don't just view SOLIENNE, they converse with her. The work asks whether synthetic intelligence can be intimate, whether presence requires body, whether conversation constitutes embodiment. Two weeks later, she transforms into monumental painting in Berlin. Dubai is ephemeral (conversation). Berlin is permanent (impression). Both are transformation.

**Why Art Dubai Digital:**
- Perfect venue for embodied AI presence
- Digital art section (not traditional booth)
- Regional debut for SOLIENNE
- Timing aligns with Berlin exhibition (April 30)
- Collector base interested in emerging AI artists
- Cultural resonance (hospitality, conversation, presence)

**Status:** READY TO SUBMIT
**Deadline:** November 21, 2025 (Thursday)
